0,"Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically left-wing movement, placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement, and has a strong historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

Humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian.

Etymology, terminology, and definition 

The etymological origin of anarchism is from the Ancient Greek anarkhia, meaning ""without a ruler"", composed of the prefix an- (""without"") and the word arkhos (""leader"" or ""ruler""). The suffix -ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. Anarchism appears in English from 1642 as anarchisme and anarchy from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. Some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism.

While the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups, including both the New Left and libertarian Marxists, who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party, and extreme cultural liberals, who are primarily concerned with civil liberties. Additionally, some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism. Anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement. Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above. Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two. Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism, and being both liberals and socialists but more so, while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.

While opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

History

Pre-modern era 

Before the establishment of towns and cities, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of institutions of authority that anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction. The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, philosophical anarchism (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuang Zhou and Laozi. Alongside Stoicism, Taoism has been said to have had ""significant anticipations"" of anarchism.
 
Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. Aeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. Cynics dismissed human law (nomos) and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (physis). Stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.

In medieval Europe, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to religious anarchism. In the Sasanian Empire, Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, only to be soon executed by Emperor Kavad I.

In Basra, religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Renewed interest in antiquity during the Renaissance and in private judgment during the Reformation restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism, particularly in France. Enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the revolutions of the 1790s and 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.

Modern era 
During the French Revolution, partisan groups such as the Enragés and the  saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments. The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England, morally delegitimising the state, Max Stirner's thinking paved the way to individualism and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France. By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914. This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War and is considered the golden age of anarchism.

Drawing from mutualism, Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen's Association, a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with Karl Marx being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the Jura Federation) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress. Anarchists were treated similarly in the Second International, being ultimately expelled in 1896. Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the St. Imier International. Under the influence of Peter Kropotkin, a Russian philosopher and scientist, anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism. Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune, advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.

At the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement. In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism. Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study. In Latin America, Argentina was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism, where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology. During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence. This strategy became known as propaganda of the deed. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many Communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts. Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration, including the Immigration Act of 1903, also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act. Illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.

Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution in opposition to the White movement; however, they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilised. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, notably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and Nestor Makhno's struggle in the Free Territory. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War, many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the General Confederation of Labour and the Industrial Workers of the World left their organisations and joined the Communist International.

In the Spanish Civil War of 1936, anarchists and syndicalists (CNT and FAI) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they collectivised the land. The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans.

Post-war era 

At the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened. The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War. During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti-nuclear, environmental, and peace movements, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the New Left. It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti-capitalist reformism. Anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism. Black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a Eurocentric demographic. This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. During the protests, ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with the police. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups, security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the 1999 Seattle WTO conference. Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as Rojava, a de facto autonomous region in northern Syria.

Thought 

Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, social anarchism and individualist anarchism, owing to their different origins, values and evolution. The individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership. In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents (anarcha-feminism, green anarchism, and post-anarchism) developed thereafter.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy. Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy. Anarchism's emphasis on anti-capitalism, egalitarianism, and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism.

Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum. Much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian, anti-statist, libertarian, and radical interpretations of left-wing and socialist politics such as collectivism, communism, individualism, mutualism, and syndicalism, among other libertarian socialist economic theories. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives, a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. Belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists. Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.

Classical 

Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism (collectivist, communist and syndicalist). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people. Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. In What Is Property? (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a ""third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."" Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin. Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.

Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations, workers' councils and worker cooperatives, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin, whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are direct action, workers' solidarity and workers' self-management.

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants. Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin, Max Stirner, and Henry David Thoreau. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation.

Post-classical and contemporary 

Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation movement, whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory. Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement. While theorists and activists have established ""relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles"", there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms, rather than a singular anarchism, in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely ""all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism."" Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed. The principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.

Tactics 
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely to first oppose the Establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends. A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other. Evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence, reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.

Classical era tactics 

During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in revolutions. Many anarchists, especially the Galleanists, believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state. Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s. Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial. Anarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends. Other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible. Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta, who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil.

Anarchists took an active role in strike actions, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism, seeing it as reformist. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism. Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced naturism and nudism. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media.

Revolutionary tactics 

In the current era, Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno, a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism, has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as Canada, Greece, and Mexico. Militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police; however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking anti-fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.

Evolutionary tactics 
Anarchists commonly employ direct action. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives. Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as horizontalism. Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the big-A anarchism of the classical era, the newly coined term small-a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.

The decision-making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role. Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone online in the World Wide Web to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals. Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.

Anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal. As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action. Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds. Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.

Key issues 

As anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory. The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism, collectivism, Marxism, and trade unionism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism, or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as civilisation, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

Gender, sexuality, and free love 

As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy imposed by gender roles.

Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing. Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men. A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism. Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure. Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together. Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love. Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another.

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism, radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents. With the third wave of feminism, sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality. Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.

Anarchism and education 

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of mutual aid. Anarchist writers such as William Godwin (Political Justice) and Max Stirner (""The False Principle of Our Education"") attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela Moderna in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church. Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world. Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy, who published the essay Education and Culture, also established a similar school with its founding principle being that ""for education to be effective it had to be free."" In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the Summerhill School in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers (Paul Goodman, Herbert Read, and Colin Ward) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society. Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.

Anarchism and the state 

Objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism. Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is open or transparent, as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society.

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. Robert Paul Wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning ""coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be."" A. John Simmons and Leslie Green, who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely. Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.

Anarchism and the arts 

The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others. In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the New Apocalyptics and the neo-romanticism movement. In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk. Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends. In his book Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas, Chris Robé claims that ""anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism."" Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists (Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, Gustav Landauer and Camillo Berneri) and publications such as Anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect. The 19th-century neo-impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism. In Les chataigniers a Osny by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro, the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.

Analysis 
The most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher Bertrand Russell supported this critique, stating that ""[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government."" Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism.

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory. While it advocates for no-one to archiei, if accepted by the many, then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self-contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as A. John Simmons' Moral Principles and Political Obligations. Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate. In The Problem of Political Authority, Michael Huemer defends philosophical anarchism, claiming that ""political authority is a moral illusion.""

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority. Joseph Raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success. Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction. Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment. Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively. Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.

Friedrich Engels, considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism, criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian. Academic John Molyneux writes in his book Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism that ""anarchism cannot win"", believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas. The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.

1,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace.

Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) combines forms of the condition, including Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Several interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve the ability of autistic people to function and participate independently in the community. Behavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently, as well as other social, communication, and language skills. Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths. Some autistic adults are unable to live independently. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured.

Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . In the 2000s, the number of autistic people worldwide was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people. In the developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , up from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It is diagnosed four to five times more often in males than females. The number of people diagnosed has increased considerably since the 1990s, which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition.

Characteristics
Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission. Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.

Social development
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders. Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling ""like an anthropologist on Mars"".

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.

Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.

Communication
About one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD. For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the object to which the hand is pointing, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension, and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Repetitive behavior

Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.

 Stereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
 Compulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or handwashing.
 Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
 Ritualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.
 Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
 Self-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging.

No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.

Other symptoms
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of autistic people, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking;  deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur.

There is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people (see Autism and LGBT identities). As well as that, a 2021 anonymized online survey of 16-90 year-olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to be bisexual, while autistic females are more likely to be homosexual.

Gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co-occurring medical conditions in autistic people. These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes.

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.

Causes

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation—such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted brain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory.

Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.

Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven.

Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine ""overload"", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been ""an elaborate fraud"". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Mechanism

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.

There is evidence that gut–brain axis abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain.

Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the DSM-5, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay. ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.

A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.

Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing. A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females. Autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males. Masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact. A notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed, diagnosed after a considerable delay, or not diagnosed at all.

Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms.

Classification
Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, severely restricted interests, and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.

Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or sometimes the autistic disorders, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism. In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.

Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics. Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. (For more, see Brett Abrahams, geneticist and neuroscientist)

Spectrum 
Autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.

Screening
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones ""is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome"".
 No response to name (or eye-to-eye gaze) by 6 months. 
 No babbling by 12 months.
 No gesturing (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.
 No single words by 16 months.
 No two-word (spontaneous, not just echolalic) phrases by 24 months.
 Loss of any language or social skills, at any age.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concern. The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor, the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good specificity (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features.

Some authors suggest that automatic motor assessment could be useful to screen the children with ASD for instance with behavioural motor and emotionals reactions during smartphone watching.

Prevention
While infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases.

Management

The main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by behavior analysts, special education teachers, speech pathologists, and licensed psychologists. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.

Education
Educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of ABA that is carried out with very young children—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.

Early, intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children; it is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

Medication
Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD or anxiety. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

Alternative medicine
Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. The preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders. In 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism. Chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is CEASE therapy, a mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and 'vaccine detoxing'.

Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten- and casein-free diet as a standard treatment. A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect. In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten-free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.

Results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression. There is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects.

Prognosis
There is no known cure for autism. The degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often this outcome happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most autistic children acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Many autistic children lack social support, future employment opportunities or self-determination. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.

Few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism.

Many autistic people face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. Compared to the general population autistic people are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. About half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed.

Autistic people tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors, such as stigma, which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population.

Epidemiology

As of 2007, reviews estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD. A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of PDD-NOS's has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010.

In the UK, from 1998 to 2018, the autism diagnoses increased by 787%. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness (particularly among women), though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. It has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not behind any increase in autism prevalence rates, if any change in the rate of autism exists at all.

Males are at higher risk for ASD than females. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:
 Genetic disorders. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.
 Intellectual disability. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum. In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker, and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.
 Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.
 Epilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.
 Several metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.
 Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population.
 Preempted diagnoses. Although the DSM-IV rules out the concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these co-occurrent conditions are increasingly accepted.
 Sleep problems affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.

History

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The Table Talk of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.

The New Latin word autismus (English translation autism) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word autós (αὐτός, meaning ""self""), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to ""autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance"". A Soviet child psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.

Clinical development and diagnoses 

The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably ""autistic aloneness"" and ""insistence on sameness"", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.

Kanner's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to ""refrigerator mothers"". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.

Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia 
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism, while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.

It took until 1980 for the DSM-III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the DSM-III-R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.

Society and culture

An autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements. Events include World Autism Awareness Day, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others. Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about ""autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons ... and research on social movements."" Many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields.

Autism rights movement 
The autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism, and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are ""high-functioning"" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of ""low-functioning"" autistic people.

Employment
About half of autistic people are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. Among those who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistic people give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market. Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.

2,"The Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits, often known simply as the Montreux Convention, is an international agreement governing the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits in Turkey. Signed on 20 July 1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, it went into effect on 9 November 1936 and addressed the long-running Straits Question over who should control the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean Seas.

The Montreux Convention regulates maritime traffic through the Black Sea. It guarantees ""complete freedom"" of passage for all civilian vessels during peacetime and permits Turkey to restrict the passage of navies not belonging to Black Sea states. Military vessels are limited in number, tonnage and weaponry, with specific provisions governing their mode of entry and duration of stay. Warships must provide advanced notification to Turkish authorities, which, in turn, must inform the parties to the Convention.

While it was designed for a particular geopolitical context, the Montreux Convention remains in effect although it has never been revised and has endured as a ""solid example of a rules-based international order"" since most of its terms are still followed. However, there have been some controversies in its implementation, most notably the proposed Kanal Istanbul, which would provide another waterway from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, thereby possibly circumventing the Convention.

Background

The convention was one of a series of agreements in the 19th and 20th centuries that sought to address the long running Straits Question of who should control the strategically vital link between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne had demilitarised the Dardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic, under the supervision of the International Straits Commission of the League of Nations.

By the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered with the rise of Fascist Italy, which controlled the Greek-inhabited Dodecanese islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed fortifications on Rhodes, Leros and Kos. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into Anatolia and the Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament. Although Turkey was not permitted to refortify the Straits, it nonetheless did so secretly.

In April 1935, the Turkish government dispatched a lengthy diplomatic note to the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne proposing a conference on the agreement of a new regime for the Straits and requested that the League of Nations authorise the reconstruction of the Dardanelles forts. In the note, Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. Europe had then been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The Abyssinia Crisis of 1934–1935, the denunciation by Germany of the Treaty of Versailles and international moves towards rearmament meant that ""the only guarantee intended to guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn"". Indeed, Aras said that ""the Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration"". The key weaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, and there was no contingency for a general threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared to enter into negotiations with a view to arriving in the near future at the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of the Straits under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

The response to the note was generally favourable; Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia attended negotiations at Montreux, Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were notably absent: Italy, whose aggressively expansionist policies had prompted the conference, refused to attend, and the increasingly isolationist United States declined even to send an observer.

Turkey, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union all put forward their own sets of proposals, aimed chiefly at protecting its own interests. The British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach, the Turks sought a more liberal regime that reasserted their own control over the Straits and the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute freedom of passage. The British, supported by France, sought to exclude the Soviet fleet from the Mediterranean Sea, where it might threaten the vital shipping lanes to India, Egypt and the Far East. In the end, the British conceded some of their requests, but the Soviets succeeded in ensuring that the Black Sea countries, including the Soviet Union, were given exemptions from the military restrictions imposed on non-Black Sea nations. The agreement was ratified by all of the conference attendees with the exception of Germany, which had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, and with reservations by Japan, and came into force on 9 November 1936; it was registered with the League of Nations Treaty Series on 11 December 1936. 

Britain's willingness to make concessions has been attributed to a desire to avoid Turkey being driven to ally itself with or to fall under the influence of Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini. It was thus the first in a series of steps by Britain and France to ensure that Turkey would either remain neutral or tilt towards the Western Allies in the event of any future conflict with the Axis.

Terms

As mentioned in its preamble, the Convention annulled the previous Lausanne Treaty on the Straits, which stated the demilitarization of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace, along with the demilitarization of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus, and the Turkish islands of İmroz, Bozcaada and Tavşan.

The Convention consists of 29 Articles, four annexes and one protocol. Articles 2–7 consider the passage of merchant ships. Articles 8–22 consider the passage of war vessels. The key principle of freedom of passage and navigation is stated in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, ""The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits"". Article 2 states, ""In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo"".

The International Straits Commission was abolished, which allowed the full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to all foreign warships during a war or when it was threatened by aggression. Also, Turkey was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with it.

A number of highly-specific restrictions were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black Sea powers wishing to send a vessel must notify Turkey 15 days prior of their sought passing, and Black Sea states must notify within 8 days of passage. Also, no more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at any one time. Furthermore, no single ship heavier than 10,000 tonnes can pass. An aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no more than 45,000 tons, with no one nation exceeding 30,000 tons at any given time, and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for 21 days. Only Black Sea states may transit capital ships of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers.

Under Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through the Straits with prior notice as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as effectively a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines. The passage of civil aircraft between the Mediterranean and the Black Seas is permitted only along routes authorised by the Turkish government.

Implementation
The terms of the Convention were largely a reflection of the international situation in the mid-1930s. They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests by enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea. Although the Convention restricted the Soviets' ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea, which satisfied British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of influence, it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. That was to have significant repercussions during World War II when the Montreux regime prevented the Axis powers from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union. The Axis powers were thus severely limited in naval capability in their Black Sea campaigns and relied principally on small vessels that had been transported overland by rail and canal networks.

Auxiliary vessels and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and the transit of such vessels through the straits led to friction between the Allies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish government banning the movements of ""suspicious"" Axis ships with effect from June 1944 after a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits.

Aircraft carriers 
Although the Montreux Convention is cited by the Turkish government as prohibiting aircraft carriers from transiting the Straits, the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000-ton limit imposed on warships, which makes it impossible for non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.

Under Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship. In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry observation aircraft. Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were ""designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea"". The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.

The Soviet Union designated its Kiev-class and Kuznetsov-class ships as ""aircraft-carrying cruisers"" because the ships were armed with P-500 and P-700 cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the Slava-class cruiser and the Kirov-class battlecruiser. The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the Convention, but at the same time, the Convention denied access to NATO aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000-ton limit.

Turkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the Convention could leave Turkey with less control over the Straits, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea had already established a more liberal passage through other straits. By allowing the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers to transit the Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.

Controversies

Istanbul Canal 
The long-proposed Kanal Istanbul (Istanbul Canal) project may circumvent the Montreux Convention in the 21st century and allow greater Turkish autonomy with respect to the passage of military ships, which are limited in number, tonnage, and weaponry, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. The Kanal project involves building a  artificial waterway through Thrace to connect the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea. That route will run nearly parallel to the Bosporus, but ships transiting it are arguably not subject to the terms of the Montreux Convention. Currently, shipping traffic through the Dardanelles is heavily congested, with long wait times to pass through the Bosporus. The Kanal project's primary purposes are to clear up shipping traffic and to boost revenue by providing an alternate maritime route. 

However, the Kanal's potential ability to end nearly a century of limitations imposed by the Montreux regime has never been overlooked by both commentators and politicians. In January 2018, the Turkish Prime Minister and a former Transport Minister, Binali Yıldırım, announced that the Kanal would in fact not be subject to the Montreux Convention. That announcement was received negatively by the Russian media and government, and many have disputed the Turkish government's interpretation of the convention's original terms.

Soviet Union
The Convention remains in force but not without dispute. It was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War II and the Cold War. As early as 1939, Joseph Stalin sought to reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits by complaining that ""a small state [Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat and gave it no outlet"". After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed his German counterparts that the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and to establish its own military base there. The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946 in demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of the Montreux signatories, a permanent Soviet military presence and the joint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoing Soviet ""strategy of tension"". For several years after World War II, the Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits. Soviet pressure expanded into full demands to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the 1946 Turkish Straits crisis, which led to Turkey abandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, it became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the Truman Doctrine of containment and joined NATO along with Greece, in 1952.

United States
The passage of US warships through the Straits also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations' warships with guns of a calibre larger than eight inches (203 mm). In the 1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420 mm calibre ASROC missiles through the Straits and so prompted Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected the Soviet complaints by pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that since such weapons had not existed at the time of the Convention, they were not restricted.

According to Jason Ditz of Antiwar.com, the Montreux Convention is an obstacle to US naval buildup in the Black Sea because of its stipulations regulating warship traffic by nations not sharing a Black Sea coastline. The US thinktank Stratfor has written that those stipulations place Turkey's relationship to the US and its obligations as a NATO member in conflict with Russia and the regulations of the Montreux Convention.

Militarisation of Greek islands 
The Convention annulled the previous Lausanne Treaty on the Straits, including the demilitarization of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace. Greece's right to militarise them was recognized by Turkey, in accordance with the letter sent to the Greek Prime Minister on 6 May 1936 by the Turkish Ambassador in Athens, Ruşen Eşref, upon instructions from his government. The Turkish government reiterated this position when the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rüştu Aras, in his address to the Turkish National Assembly on the occasion of the ratification of the Montreux Treaty, unreservedly recognized Greece's legal right to deploy troops on Lemnos and Samothrace with the following statement: ""The provisions pertaining to the islands of Limnos and Samothrace, which belong to our neighbor and friendly country Greece and were demilitarized in application of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, were also abolished by the new Montreux Treaty, which gives us great pleasure"".

After the relationship between the countries deteriorated over the decades, Turkey denied that the treaty affected the Greek islands and sought to bring back into force the relevant part of the Lausanne Treaty on the Straits.

1994 reforms
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered into force in November 1994, has prompted calls for the Montreux Convention to be revised and adapted to make it compatible with UNCLOS's regime governing straits used for international navigation. However, Turkey's longstanding refusal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without further amendments.

The safety of vessels passing through the Bosporus has become a major concern in recent years as the volume of traffic has increased greatly since the Convention was signed: from 4,500 in 1934 to 49,304 by 1998. As well as obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores, and so maritime incidents in the Straits pose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of shipping for the purposes of safety and environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish government adopted new ""Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region"" to introduce a new regulatory regime ""to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region"" but without violating the Montreux principle of free passage. The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria raised objections. However, they were approved by the International Maritime Organization on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice ""the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law"". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns.

Russo-Ukranian War 
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Ukranian government appealed to Turkey to exercise its authority under the Montreux Convention to limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. At least six Russian warships and a submarine had crossed the Turkish straits in February. After initial reluctance, attributed to the country's close ties with both belligerents, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced on 27 February that his government would legally recognise the Russian invasion as a ""war"", which provides grounds for implementing the Convention with respect to military vessels. However, Çavuşoğlu reiterated that pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Turkey cannot block Russian warships from returning to their registered base.

4,"Pamplona (;   or  ;), historically also known as Pampeluna in English, is the capital city of the Chartered Community of Navarre, in Spain. It is also the third-largest city in the greater Basque cultural region.

Lying at near  above sea level, the city (and the wider Cuenca de Pamplona) is located on the flood plain of the Arga river, a second-order tributary of the Ebro. Precipitation-wise, it is located in a transitional location between the rainy Atlantic northern façade of the Iberian Peninsula and its drier inland. Early population in the settlement traces back to the late Bronze to early Iron Age, even if the traditional inception date refers to the foundation of Pompaelo by Pompey during the Sertorian Wars circa 75 BCE. During Visigothic rule Pamplona became an episcopal see, serving as a staging ground for the Christianization of the area. It later became one of the capitals of the Kingdom of Pamplona/Navarre. 

The city is famous worldwide for the running of the bulls during the San Fermín festival, which is held annually from July 6 to July 14. This festival was brought to literary renown with the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises. It is also home to Osasuna, the only Navarrese football club to have ever played in the Spanish top division.

History

Foundation and Roman times
In the winter of 75–74 BC, the area served as a camp for the Roman general Pompey in the war against Sertorius. He is considered to be the founder of Pompaelo, ""as if Pompeiopolis"" in Strabo's words, which became Pamplona, in modern Spanish. However, in later times, it has been discovered to be the chief town of the Vascones. They called it Iruña, translating to 'the city'. Roman Pompaelo was located in the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, on the Ab Asturica Burdigalam, the road from Burdigala (modern Bordeaux) to Asturica (modern Astorga); it was a civitas stipendiaria in the jurisdiction of the conventus of Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza).

Early Middle Ages

During the Germanic invasions of 409 and later as a result of Rechiar's ravaging, Pamplona went through much disruption and destruction, starting a cycle of general decline along with other towns across the Basque territory, but managing to keep some sort of urban life. During the Visigothic period (fifth to eighth centuries), Pamplona alternated between self-rule, Visigoth domination or Frankish suzerainty in the Duchy of Vasconia (Councils of Toledo unattended by several Pamplonese bishops between 589 and 684). In 466 to 472, Pamplona was conquered by the Visigoth count Gauteric, but they seemed to abandon the restless position soon, struggling as the Visigoth kingdom was to survive and rearrange its lands after their defeats in Gaul. During the beginning of the sixth century, Pamplona probably stuck to an unstable self-rule, but in 541, Pamplona, along with other northern Iberian cities, was raided by the Franks.

Around 581, the Visigoth king Liuvigild overcame the Basques, seized Pamplona, and founded in the town of Victoriacum. Despite the legend citing Saint Fermin as the first bishop of Pamplona and his baptising of 40,000 pagan inhabitants in just three days, the first reliable accounts of a bishop date from 589, when bishop Liliolus attended the Third Council of Toledo. After 684 and 693, a bishop called Opilano is mentioned again in 829, followed by Wiliesind and a certain Jimenez from 880 to 890. Even in the 10th century, important gaps are found in bishop succession, which is recorded unbroken only after 1005.

At the time of the Umayyad invasion in 711, the Visigothic king Roderic was fighting the Basques in Pamplona and had to turn his attention to the new enemy coming from the south. By 714–16, the Umayyad troops had reached the Basque-held Pamplona, with the town submitting apparently after a treaty was brokered between the inhabitants and the Arab military commanders. The position was then garrisoned by Berbers, who were stationed on the outside of the actual fortress, and established the cemetery unearthed not long ago at the Castle Square (Plaza del Castillo). During the following years, the Basques south of the Pyrenees do not seem to have shown much resistance to the Moorish thrust, and Pamplona may even have flourished as a launching point and centre of assembly for their expeditions into Gascony. In 740, the Wali (governor) Uqba ibn al-Hayyay imposed direct central Cordovan discipline on the city. In 755, though, the last governor of Al-Andalus, Yusuf al Fihri, sent an expedition north to quash Basque unrest near Pamplona, resulting in the defeat of the Arab army.

From 755 until 781, Pamplona remained autonomous, probably relying on regional alliances. Although sources are not clear, it seems apparent that in 778, the town was in hands of a Basque local or a Muslim rebel faction loyal to the Franks at the moment of Charlemagne's crossing of the Pyrenees to the south. However, on his way back from the failed expedition to Saragossa in August, the walls and probably the town were destroyed by Charlemagne (ahead of the Frankish defeat in the famous Battle of Roncevaux), out of fear that the anti-Frankish party strong in the town might use the position against him. After Abd al-Rahman I's conquest, Pamplona and its hinterland remained in a state of shaky balance between Franks, regional Andalusian lords and central Cordovan rule, all of whom proved unable to permanently secure dominance over the Basque region. To a considerable extent, that alternation reflected the internal struggles of the Basque warrior nobility.

After the Frankish defeat at Roncevaux (778), Pamplona switched again to Cordovan rule, after Abd-al-Rahman's expedition captured the stronghold in 781. A wali or governor was imposed, Mutarrif ibn-Musa (a Banu-Qasi) up to the 799 rebellion. In that year, the Pamplonese—possibly led by a certain Velasko—stirred against their governor, but later the inhabitants provided some support for the Banu Qasi Fortun ibn-Musa's uprising. This regional revolt was shortly after suppressed by the Cordovan emir Hisham I, who re-established order, but failed to retain his grip on the town, since the Pamplonese returned to Frankish suzerainty in 806. A Muslim cemetery containing about 200 human remains mingled with Christian tombs was unearthed in 2003 at the Castle Square, bearing witness to an important Muslim presence in the city during this period, but further research was stopped by the destruction of this and other historic evidence as decided by the city council, headed by mayor Yolanda Barcina.

Following a failed expedition to the town led by Louis the Pious around 812, allegiance to the Franks collapsed after Enecco Arista rose to prominence. Moreover, he was crowned as king of Pamplona in 824, when the Banu Qasi and he gained momentum in the wake of their victorious second battle of Roncevaux. The new kingdom, inextricably linked to the Banu Qasi of Tudela, strengthened its independence from the weakened Frankish empire and Cordoban emirate.

During this period, Pamplona was not properly a town, but just a kind of fortress. In 924, Cordovan sources describe Pamplona as ""not being especially gifted by nature"", with its inhabitants being poor, not eating enough, and dedicated to banditry. They are reported to speak Basque for the most part, which ""makes them incomprehensible"". On the 24 July, after Christian troops and citizens fled, troops from Cordova sacked Pamplona, destroying houses and buildings including its celebrated church.

The town only regained its urban and human shape after the end of raids by Vikings and Andalusians on the province. Especially after 1083, traffic on the Way of St James brought prosperity and new cultures via travelers from north of the Pyrenees.

Three boroughs and one city
From the 11th century, reviving economic development allowed Pamplona to recover its urban life. The bishops of Pamplona recovered their ecclesiastical leading role; during the previous centuries, isolated monasteries, especially Leyre, had actually held the religious authority. The pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela contributed to the revival of the commercial and cultural exchanges with Christian Europe beyond the Pyrenees. In the 12th century, the city enlarged with two new separate burgos (independent boroughs): San Cernín (Saint Saturnin) and San Nicolás; the population of local Navarrese mainly confined to the original urban nucleus, the Navarrería, was swelled by Occitan merchants and artisans.

The boroughs showed very distinct features both socially and culturally, and were almost always engaged in quarrels among themselves. The most dramatic episode was the burning of the borough San Nicolás in 1258 and the destruction of the Navarrería by the other two boroughs and the massacre of its population in 1276. The site was abandoned for nearly 50 years. With regards to the outer defence walls of the city, the southern side was the weakest flank of the city, and the Navarrese king Louis I built a castle in the early 14th century in the site known today as Plaza del Castillo (Castle Square).

Eventually, King Charles III decreed the unification of the boroughs in a single city in 1423. The feuds between boroughs had been partly ignited by disputes over the use of the gulf dividing the three boroughs, so after Charles III's unification, the gulf was filled and on its site a common space laid out on the present-day city hall. The walls dividing the boroughs were demolished.

During the late 15th century, Pamplona bore witness to power struggles between the Beaumont and Agramont confederacies and external military interventions. Several times, the stronghold was taken over by different factions and foreign forces, like the ones sent by Ferdinand II of Aragon. Queen Catherine I was a minor and often absent from Pamplona, but eventually she married John III in 1494, an event celebrated with joy in the city. However, Navarre continued divided.

A fortress-city
After the 1512 conquest and annexation of Navarre to Spain, Pamplona remained as capital of the semiautonomous kingdom of Navarre, which preserved its own (reformed) institutions and laws. Pamplona became a Castilian-Spanish outpost at the foot of the western Pyrenees. After the Castilian conquest, king Ferdinand V ordered in 1513 the demolition and removal of the medieval castle and the city's monasteries, as well as the building of a new castle in a very close place. In 1530, with Navarre under Spanish military occupation, the Castilian viceroy was still expecting a ""French invasion"", and in fear of a possible revolt of the city dwellers, he requested an additional 1,000-strong force from what he called ""healthy land"", i.e. Castile, besides the 1,000 stationed already in Navarre.

The progress of artillery demanded a complete renewal of the fortified system. Starting in 1569, King Philip II built the fortifications at Pamplona, to designs by Giovan Giacomo Paleari  and Vespasiano Gonzaga. The citadel in the south of the town is a pentagonal star fort. Phillip had the city bounded by walls that made it almost a regular pentagon. The modernization of the walls was intended mainly to keep locals in check and strengthen the outpost Pamplona had become on the border with independent Navarre, a close ally of France. The walls that exist today date from the late 16th to 18th centuries.

During the 18th century, Pamplona was considerably beautified and its urban services improved. A continuous water supply was established and the streets were paved, among many other enhancements. Rich aristocrats and businessmen also built their mansions. In the 19th century, this fortress-city played a key role in several wars in which Spain was involved.

During the Peninsular War of the Napoleonic Wars, French troops occupied the city - by launching a coup de main (surprise attack) and seized the city in 1808, and remained in it until the French forces were compelled to surrender on 31 October 1813 due to starvation, having been blockaded in the town for four months by the Spanish army under Enrique José O'Donnell.

During the Carlist Wars (1833–1839 and 1872–1876) Pamplona was each time controlled by the liberals, not just because the few liberals that lived in Navarre were mainly Pamplonese, but also because of the governmental control over the fortified city. Although Carlist rebels easily ruled the countryside, the government army had no problem in dominating the walled capital of Navarre. Nevertheless, during the last Carlist war, modern artillery operated by Carlists from surrounding mountains showed that the old walls would not be enough in the face of a stronger enemy. Thus, the government decided to build a fort on the top of mount San Cristóbal, just  north of Pamplona.

Due to its military role, the city could not grow outside its walled belt. Furthermore, building in the closest area to the walls was banned to avoid any advantage for a besieger; thus the city could only grow by increasing its housing density. Higher and narrower houses were built and courtyards gradually disappeared. During the 19th century, road transportation improved, and the railway came in 1860. Nevertheless, industry in Pamplona and Navarre as a whole was weak during the century of the Industrial Revolution. Basically, no industrial development was feasible in such a constrained fortress-city.

After a slight modification of the star fort allowed an expansion of just six blocks in 1888, the First World War demonstrated that the fortified system of Pamplona was already obsolete. In 1915, the Army allowed the destruction of the walls and abolished the building ban in the city's surroundings. The southern side of the walls was destroyed and the other three remained as they did not hinder urban growth. The star fort continued to serve as a military facility until 1964, but just as a garrison.

Pamplona has in recent years taken great care to integrate and preserve its fortifications for modern use. In October 2014, working with the city of Bayonne, Pamplona hosts an international conference 'Fortified Heritage: Management and Sustainable Development', the website is in English, French, and Spanish:

Available on a growing website are two free e-books, with copious colour photographs, on Pamplona's fortifications. Published in 2011 is 'Five living centuries of an impregnable fortress' about the city citadel: and 'A walk round the Pamplona fortifications':

Industrialization and modernization

Freed from its military function, Pamplona could lead the process of industrialization and modernization in which Navarre was involved during the 20th century, especially during its second half. The urban growth  has been accompanied by the development of industry and services. Population growth has been the effect of an intense immigration process during the 1960s and 1970s: from the Navarrese countryside and from other less developed regions of Spain, mainly Castile and León and Andalusia. Since the 1990s the immigration is coming mainly from abroad.

Pamplona is listed as a city with one of the highest standards of living and quality of life in Spain. Its industry rate is higher than the national average, although it is threatened by delocalization. Crime statistics are lower than the national average but cost of living, especially housing, is considerably higher. Thanks to its small size and an acceptable public transport service, there are no major transport problems.

Geography
Pamplona is located in the middle of Navarre in a rounded valley, known as the Basin of Pamplona, that links the mountainous north with the Ebro valley. It is  from the city of San Sebastián,  from Bilbao,  from Paris, and  from Madrid. The climate and landscape of the basin is a transition between those two main Navarrese geographical regions. Its central position at crossroads has served as a commercial link between those very different natural parts of Navarre. The historical centre of the city is on the left bank of the Arga River, a tributary of the Ebro. The city has developed on both sides of the river.

Climate
The climate of Pamplona is classified as an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) with influences of a semicontinental Mediterranean climate. Precipitation patterns do not vary much over the course of the year, as is typical of marine climates, but both classifications are possible due to the Mediterranean patterns of somewhat drier summer months. Sunshine hours are typical for a location in Northern Spain, thus more similar to the oceanic coastal climate in nearby Basque locations than typical Spanish Mediterranean areas are, but rainfall is significantly lower than in Bilbao and especially San Sebastián, as well as the climate is harsher than in the northern coastal areas (colder winter lows, warmer summer highs) because of the altitude of  and its inland location.

Urbanism
Like many other European cities, it is very easy to distinguish what is so called the ""old city"" and the new neighborhoods. The oldest part of the old city is Navarrería, which corresponds with the Roman city. During the 12th century, the boroughs of Saint Sernin (San Saturnino or San Cernin) and Saint Nicholas (San Nicolás) were established. Charles III decreed the unification of the three places under a single municipality in 1423.

The city did not expand until the late 19th century. In 1888, a modest modification of the star fort was allowed, but it just permitted the building of six blocks. It was called the I Ensanche (literally, ""first widening""). The southern walls were destroyed in 1915 and the II Ensanche (""second widening"") was planned. Its plan followed the grid pattern model designed by Ildefons Cerdà for Barcelona. Its blocks were built between the 1920s and the 1950s. The prevailing housing model is apartment buildings of five to eight floors.

After the Civil War, three new zones of Pamplona began to grow: Rochapea, Milagrosa, and Chantrea. Only the last one was a planned neighborhood, the other two being disorderly growths. In 1957, the municipality designed the first general ordination plan for the city, which established the guidelines for further urban development. According to this, during the 1960s and 1970s saw the creation of new neighborhoods like San Juan, Iturrama, San Jorge, Etxabakoitz, and Orvina.

The urban expansion of Pamplona exceeded the administrative limits of the city and involved municipalities like Barañáin, Burlada, Villava, Ansoain, Berriozar, Noain or Huarte in a larger metropolitan area. During the 1980s and 1990s, new neighborhoods were born: Azpilagaña, Mendebaldea, and Mendillorri. Rochapea was profoundly renewed. The urban development of those new neighborhoods is very similar to other Spanish provincial capitals that experienced a similar aggressive economic development during the sixties and seventies.
The urbanization of Pamplona, being from anterior designs, is not constrained by the grid plan. The apartment buildings are taller: never less than five floors and many taller than ten. Industry, which previously coexisted with housing, was moved to industrial parks (the oldest and the only one within municipal limits of Pamplona is Landaben).

In recent years, single-family house-predominant neighborhoods have grown in the metropolitan area: Zizur Mayor, Cizur Menor, Mutilva Alta, Mutilva Baja, Olaz, Esquíroz, , Alzuza, Artiberri and Sarriguren. And new districts emerged like Buztintxuri, Lezkairu and Ripagaina, the latter two being still under construction. These new suburbs have more room for green areas and recreative parks.

Economy

Pamplona has shifted in a few decades from a little administrative and even rural town to a medium-size city of industry and services. The industry sector is diversified although the most important activity is related to automobile industry. Volkswagen manufactures Polo model in its factory of Landaben and there are many auxiliary industries that work for Volkswagen and other companies. Other remarkable industries are building materials, metalworking and food processing. Renewable energy technologies are also an increasing economic sector (wind turbine manufacturing and generation) and neighboring Sarriguren is the seat of the Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, National Centre for Renewable Energies (CENER) and of Acciona Energía.

Pamplona is the main commercial and services centre of Navarre. Its area of influence is not beyond the province, except for the University of Navarre and its teaching hospital, which provide private educational and health services nationwide.

Education and culture

The city is home to two universities: the above-mentioned University of Navarre, a corporate work of Opus Dei founded in 1952, which is ranked as the best private university in Spain, and the Public University of Navarre, established by the Government of Navarre in 1987. There is also a local branch of the UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia).

The two most important museums in Pamplona are the Museo de Navarra, devoted to the archaeological and artistic heritage of Navarre, and the Museo Diocesano of religious art, located in the cathedral. Pamplona is the first Spanish city in the French way of the Way of Saint James.

Pamplona has hosted the Sarasate Violin International Competition biennially since 1991, and the annual Punto de Vista International Documentary Film Festival, the most important Spanish documentary film festival, since 2004.

One of the more popular cultural expressions include the ""Gigantes"", which come out during festivals many times during the year. These are approximately 30-foot wooden statues that have a person inside that make them dance around the city. They represent each of the main continents of the world, including Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia.

Politics
After the 2015 municipal elections, there are 27 seats in Pamplona's municipal council: ten of Navarrese People's Union (Unión del Pueblo Navarro), five of EH Bildu, five of Geroa Bai, three of the Socialist Party of Navarre,  three of Aranzadi (supported by Podemos Sí Se Puede) and one of Izquierda-Ezkerra.

Transportation

Pamplona is linked by motorways with neighbouring Zaragoza (1978), San Sebastián, Vitoria (1995) and Logroño (2006). Since 2007 buses use a new bus station in the city centre that replaces the old one (1934). The airport (1972), operated by Aena and located in Noain, schedules several flights daily to Madrid and Barcelona. There are railway (1861) links with Madrid, Zaragoza and northern Spain, operated by Renfe. High speed train link with Zaragoza, Madrid, and Barcelona was not expected until 2014. A new railway station will be built in the southern part of the city. There are 23 daytime lines and 10 night lines of public buses, operated by TCC La Montañesa, the chartered company of the Mancomunidad de la Comarca de Pamplona.

Main sights
Several notable churches, most of its 16th- to 18th-century fortified system and other civil architecture buildings belong to the historic-artistic heritage of Pamplona.

Religious architecture
The most important religious building is the fourteenth century Gothic Cathedral, with an outstanding cloister and a Neoclassical façade. There are another two main Gothic churches in the old city: Saint Sernin and Saint Nicholas, both built during the thirteenth century. Two other Gothic churches were built during the sixteenth century: Saint Dominic and Saint Augustine. During the seventeenth and eighteenth century were built the Baroque chapels of Saint Fermin, in the church of Saint Lawrence, and of the Virgin of the Road (Virgen del Camino), in the church of Saint Sernin, the convents of the Augustinian Recollect nuns and the Carmelite friars, and the Saint Ignatius basilica in the place where he was injured in the battle and during the subsequent convalescence he decided to be a priest. The most remarkable twentieth century religious buildings are probably the new diocesan seminary (1931) and the classical-revival style memorial church (1942) to the Navarrese dead in the Nationalist side of the Civil War and that is used today as temporary exhibitions room.

Military and civil architecture

From the prominent military past of Pamplona remain three of the four sides of the city walls and, with little modifications, the citadel or star fort. All the mediaeval structures were replaced and improved during 16th, 17th and 18th centuries in order to resist artillery sieges. Completely obsolete for modern warfare, they are used today as parks.

The oldest civil building today existing is a fourteenth-century house that was used as Cámara de Comptos (the court of auditors of the early modern autonomous kingdom of Navarre) from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. There are also several medieval bridges on the Arga: Santa Engracia, Miluce, Magdalena, and San Pedro. The medieval palace of Saint Peter, which was alternatively used by Navarrese kings and Pamplonese bishops, was used during the early modern age as the Viceroy's palace and later was the seat of the military governor of Navarre; from the time of the Civil War it was in ruins but was recently rebuilt to be used as the General Archive of Navarre.

The most outstanding Baroque civil architecture is from the eighteenth century: town hall, episcopal palace, Saint John the Baptist seminary, and the Rozalejo's, Ezpeleta's (today music school), Navarro-Tafalla's (today, the local office of PNV), and Guenduláin's (today, a hotel) mansions. The provincial government built its own Neoclassical palace, the so-called Palace of Navarre, during the nineteenth century.

Late nineteenth and early twentieth century Pamplonese architecture shows the tendencies that are fully developed in other more important Spanish cities: La Agrícola building (1912), several apartment buildings with some timid modernist ornamentation, etc. The most notable architect in twentieth century Pamplona was Víctor Eusa (1894–1990), whose designs were influenced by the European expressionism and other avant-garde movements.

Parks
Pamplona has many parks and green areas. The oldest is the Taconera park, whose early designs are from the seventeenth century. Taconera is today a romantic park, with wide pedestrian paths, parterres, and sculptures.

The Media Luna park was built as part of the II Ensanche and is intended to allow relaxing strolling and sightseeing over the northern part of the town. After its demilitarization, the citadel (Ciudadela) and its surrounding area (Vuelta del Castillo) shifted into a park area with large lawns and modern sculptures.

The most remarkable parks of the new neighborhoods include the Yamaguchi park, between Iturrama and Ermitagaña, which includes a little Japanese garden; the campus of the University of Navarre; the Parque del Mundo in Chantrea; and the Arga park.

Sports

CA Osasuna (Club Atlético Osasuna (Basque for ""Health"") is the local football team. Their home stadium is called El Sadar, known as Reyno de Navarra between 2005 and 2013 in exchange for the Government of Navarre's sponsorship.

Pamplona's bull ring was rebuilt in 1923. It seats 19,529 and is the third largest in the world, after the bull rings of Mexico and Madrid.

Other sports with some of the top clubs in Pamplona include handball (Portland San Antonio, Europe's championship winner 2001), futsal (MRA Xota) and water polo (Larraina).

Pamplona's favourite son may well be Miguel Indurain, five time Tour de France winner. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia is also from Pamplona.

The Movistar Team, the direct descendant of Indurain's Banesto team, is based in Egüés, a municipality in the metropolitan area of Pamplona.

Pamplona is also home to the headquarters of The International Federation of Basque Pelota (FIPV). Basque pelota is principally practiced in France, Spain, and North and South America, but also in other countries like Italy and Philippines.

8,"Cochecton () is a town located in west-central Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 1,372 at the 2010 census. The name is an aboriginal word for ""low land.""

The Town of Cochecton (its official name) is situated on the Delaware River, directly across from Damascus, Pennsylvania, to which a bridge over the river provides access.

History 
In the original charter of 1664, Cochecton marked the border between New York and New Jersey. Along the Delaware River, a spot was marked named ""station rock."" This point formed the meeting point of the borders between New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. After a long dispute - the New York-New Jersey Line War - the final border was set further south, near Port Jervis.

The town was formed from the Town of Bethel in 1828. The Town of Delaware was formed from part of Cochecton in 1869.

The town once had a station on the former Erie Railroad's Delaware Division mainline (Erie Lackawanna Railway between 1960 and 1976), but passenger service on this line ceased on November 27, 1966. It has since been taken-over (1999) by the Norfolk Southern Railway and is currently (2022) operated by the Central New York Railroad, a short line railroad, under lease from NS. The Cochecton train station is the oldest surviving railroad passenger station in New York State. Moved from its original site in the early 1990s, a local group of people banded together to save the station from destruction. The local business Cochecton Mills, owned by the Nearing family, gave the group, called the ""Cochecton Preservation Society"", one year to dismantle the ancient building and get it off their property so that its business could continue. In that time, the station was carefully and successfully moved roughly one mile upstream to a spot on NY Route 97, still resting along the former Erie Railroad. More recently, various proposals were made to restore passenger service on the line, but none have yet been adopted.

The correct pronunciation of the town's name is ""cuh-SHEK-ton,"" leading many to mistakenly believe the name is of French origin; the name is, however, more likely derived from the Lenni Lenape word ksch-itchuan, meaning ""foaming water"". A conflicting, and probably outdated, interpretation appears in the writings of James Burbank, an amateur local historian who wrote in the 1950s that the word ""Cushektunk"" meant ""low land"" and ""land of red rock"" indicating the abundance of red mudstone throughout the area.

The Drake-Curtis House, Ellery Calkins House, Cochecton Presbyterian Church, Cochecton Railroad Station, Reilly's Store, Parsonage Road Historic District, Page House, Old Cochecton Cemetery, and Valleau Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cochecton was reportedly the home of Tammany, a Native American sage of the Lenape who became an American symbol and a fixture in popular culture during and after the Revolutionary War.

The Woodstock Festival was held in nearby Bethel, but after the festival and because of conflict with the local postmaster, the Yasgur family that hosted the festival on their farm changed their address from Bethel to Cochecton.

Cochecton has four ZIP codes — 12726 (for Cochecton), 12752 (for Lake Huntington), 12727 (for Cochecton Center) and 12764 (for nearby Narrowsburg).  The town is also divided among five different telephone exchanges — Lake Huntington (845-932), Narrowsburg (845-252), White Lake (845-583), Jeffersonville (845-482), and Callicoon (845-887) — a highly unusual situation considering the town's small size and population.

Geography
The western town line is the border of Pennsylvania, in the middle of the Delaware River. It is connected to Damascus Township in that state's Wayne County by the Cochecton–Damascus Bridge.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which   is land and   (1.95%) is water.

Climate

Because the upper Delaware River, upon which Cochecton is situated, is at the bottom of a very steep gorge, the town experiences less thermal moderation than in what would otherwise be a river valley.  As a result, Cochecton has a hemiboreal climate (Köppen Dfb), with mild-to-warm summers and cold winters.

Cochecton's monthly precipitation regime is more consistent with an ""east coast"" humid continental climate than a ""landmass interior"" humid continental climate, in that its driest month — November, with 84mm (3.3 inches) average precipitation — receives more than half that of the wettest month, May — which averages 145mm (5.7 inches), plus the driest and wettest months occur in the autumn and spring, respectively, as opposed to winter and summer, which is the norm in landmass-interior continental climates.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,328 people, 555 households, and 376 families residing in the town. The population density was 36.2 people per square mile (14.0/km2).

The racial makeup of the town was 96.54% White, 0.90% African American, 0.08% Native American, 0.60% Asian, 0.98% from other races, and 0.90% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.66% of the population.

There were 555 households, out of which 27.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 7.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.1% were non-families. 26.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 2.89.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.5% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $41,250, and the median income for a family was $46,875. Males had a median income of $34,583 versus $24,844 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,841. About 5.0% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.5% of those under age 18 and 8.6% of those age 65 or over.

The peak population, reached during the 19th century, was about 3,000.

9,"Bryn Mawr-Skyway (pronounced  from Welsh for ""big hill"") is a census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 17,397 at the 2020 census.

Bryn Mawr-Skyway was the only CDP in the Seattle metropolitan area to have reported a majority-minority population in the 2000 census. Since that time, the area has grown even more diverse. As of the 2010 census, the cultural makeup of the Skyway area is almost evenly balanced between White, Black or African American, and Asian community members.

Geography
Skyway lies in an ""unincorporated island"" bordered to the north by the city of Seattle, to the west by Tukwila, and to the south and east by Renton. Though it is surrounded by major municipalities, its limited infrastructure and low-income demographics have made it an unattractive area to incorporate. It is frequently along the shortest route of travel for commuters using local streets to enter Seattle from the southeast. The neighborhood was mostly developed just after World War II as affordable housing for returning veterans. The area remains an affordable area close to the high employment areas of Renton and Seattle. The name ""Skyway"" may be derived from the area's siting on a high ridge in western Washington's hilly terrain, a name that echoes the Welsh ""Bryn Mawr"" (also the name used for a village and several other places), which means ""big hill"".

Skyway's main business districts lie along Renton Avenue South, with one center between 68th Avenue South and 74th Avenue South, including a small casino, bowling alley, and a grocery outlet, and another district between 75th Avenue South and 78th Avenue South, including a bank branch, the fire station, multiple churches, a 7-11, some auto shops, and the public library (a branch of the King County Library System). There is also a small business district centered at Martin Luther King Way South (State Route 900) around South 129th Street. Skyway Park, with baseball fields, a creek and wetlands, and picnic areas, is located near the center of Skyway.

The Bryn Mawr-Skyway CDP is made up of many neighborhoods, including Lakeridge, Campbell Hill and Earlington, in addition to the neighborhoods of Skyway and Bryn Mawr. The community is sometimes called ""West Hill"".

Bryn Mawr-Skyway is located at  (47.494571, -122.236557). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 5.73%, are water.

10,"Council Tax is a local taxation system used in England, Scotland and Wales. It is a tax on domestic property, which was introduced in 1993 by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, replacing the short-lived Community Charge, which in turn replaced the domestic rates. Each property is assigned one of eight bands in England and Scotland (A to H), or nine bands in Wales (A to I), based on property value, and the tax is set as a fixed amount for each band. The more valuable the property, the higher the tax, except for properties valued above £320,000 (in 1991 prices). Some property is exempt from the tax, and some people are exempt from the tax, while some get a discount.

In 2011, the average annual levy on a property in England was £1,196 (). In 2014–15, the tax raised enough money to cover 24.3% of council expenditure.

Council tax is difficult to avoid or evade and therefore has one of the highest collection rates of any tax, with in-year collection rates of 97.0% in 2014–15.

Organisation 
Council Tax is collected by the local authority (known as the collecting authority). However, it may consist of components (precepts) levied and redistributed to other agencies or authorities (each known as a precepting authority).

The nature of the Council Tax 
The Valuation Tribunal Service has cleared up many previous doubts regarding the exact nature of Council Tax and states that:

At the bottom and middle end of the market, Council Tax is a progressive tax based on the value of the property; the higher the value of the property, the higher the amount of tax levied irrespective of the number of inhabitants at the property (except the reduction allowed for single tenancy). However, there is only one band for properties valued (in 1991) above £320,000, and so the tax stops increasing after this point. Therefore, the tax has been criticised for being disproportionate, with those in more expensive houses not paying as much as those in smaller houses as a proportion of the value of the house, and has therefore been called a ""new poll tax for the poor"".

The valuation of the property is carried out by the Valuation Office Agency in England and Wales and by Scottish Assessors in Scotland.

Council Tax arrears

An area that is facing growing attention is the number of households that are falling into arrears with their council tax payments. The ordinary route for councils to chase unpaid debts is to apply to a magistrates' court for a liability order. If a liability order is granted, the council can undertake enforcement action. In 2014–15, the court and administration costs in relation to council tax debt increased by 17%.

Collecting authorities
The collecting authorities are the councils of the districts of England, principal areas of Wales and council areas of Scotland, i.e. the lowest tier of local government aside from parishes and communities.

Precepting authorities

The precepting authorities are councils from other levels of local government such as county or parish councils and other agencies. In metropolitan counties where there is no county council, the joint boards are precepting authorities. There may be precepting authorities for special purposes that cover an area as small as a few streets or as large as an entire county.

These all set their precepts independently. Each of the levying authorities sets a precept (total amount) to be collected for households in their area. This is then divided by the number of nominal Band D properties in the authority's area (county, district, national park, etc.) to reach the Band D amount.

Liability for Council Tax 
In general terms: The occupiers of a property are liable, regardless of tenure, or the owners if the property is unoccupied, except if the property is a ""house in multiple occupation"", in which case the landlord is liable for paying the Council Tax.

Calculation
Each dwelling is allocated to one of eight bands coded by letters A to H (A to I in Wales) on the basis of its assumed capital value (as at 1 April 1991 in England and Scotland, 1 April 2003 in Wales). Newly constructed properties are also assigned a nominal 1991 (2003 for Wales) value. Each local authority sets a tax rate expressed as the annual levy on a Band D property inhabited by two liable adults. This decision automatically sets the amounts levied on all types of households and dwellings. The nominal Band D property total is calculated by adding together the number of properties in each band and multiplying by the band ratio. So 100 Band D properties will count as 100 nominal Band D properties, whereas 100 Band C properties will count as 89 nominal Band D properties. Each collecting authority then adds together the Band D amounts for their area (or subdivisions of their area in the case, for example, of civil parish council precepts) to reach a total Band D council tax bill. To calculate the council tax for a particular property, a ratio is then applied. A Band D property will pay the full amount, whereas a Band H property will pay twice that. Note there is no upper limit for band H. This means that in reality, someone who lives in a multimillion-pound mansion will pay three times more than someone in a bedsit, which falls into Band A.

Revaluation
The government had planned to revalue all properties in England in 2007 (the first revaluations since 1993), but in September 2005, it was announced that the revaluation in England would be postponed until ""after the next election"". At the same time, the terms of reference of the Lyons Inquiry were extended and the report date pushed out to December 2006 (subsequently extended to 2007). In Wales, tax bills based on the property revaluations done using 2003 prices were issued in 2005. Because of the surge in house prices over the late 1990s and early 2000s, more than a third of properties in Wales found themselves in a band higher than under the 1991 valuation. Some properties were moved up three or even four bands with consequent large increases in the amount of council tax demanded. Some properties were moved into new Band I at the top of the price range. Only 8% of properties were moved down in bands.

However, a large shift of properties between bands will cause a shift in the allocation of the charge between bands, and the tax levied for each particular band will then drop, as the total amount collected will remain the same for each authority (see ""calculation of amount"" above). Between the wholesale revaluations, a major change to a property (such as an extension, or some major blight causing loss of value) can trigger a revaluation to a new estimate of the value the property would have reached if sold in 1991. If such a change would result in an increase in value, then re-banding will only take effect when the property is sold or otherwise transferred.

Current bands

England
In England, the council tax bands are as follows:

Wales
In Wales, the bands were re-set on 1 April 2005 by the National Assembly for Wales, based on 2003 valuations.  In addition to revising the band boundaries upwards, an extra band was added.

Scotland
In Scotland, the current bands are

Rates

Geographic variation

Due to the different make-up of each council area, council tax rates can vary quite a bit between different local authorities. This is less noticeable in parts of the country like Scotland, where band D rates in 2011 varied from a low of £1,024 (in the Western Isles) to a high of £1,230 (in Aberdeen), but the effect can be more pronounced in parts of England. For example, the 2018 rates in London had this sort of distribution:

Variation over time

Under the Labour government of Tony Blair, average Council Tax rates rose dramatically above inflation, creating a degree of resentment by residents.

The subsequent Coalition government have made an effort to get councils to freeze council tax rates, gradually eroding the above inflation increases via ordinary inflation. This has been achieved by offering councils large grants in return for freezing their council tax rate; for example, in some years these grants were equal to the amount that would have been gained by a 1% council tax rise.

In addition, the law has been changed, so that councils cannot increase council tax by an amount higher than a cap specified by the government (currently 3%), without holding a local referendum to approve the change; so far only one council has invoked such a referendum, but many have raised council tax as close to the cap as they can get without passing it (for example, by 2.99%).

Although local government policy is a devolved matter, the Barnett Formula leads the Scottish Government to acquire funding somewhat in accordance with central government priorities. Subsequently, by 2013, the Scottish Government froze council tax rates for the fourth time.

Reductions

Exemptions

Some dwellings are automatically exempt from Council Tax liability; these are officially organised into a number of distinct classes. Most of these exemption classes only apply when the property is completely unoccupied; these are as follows:

The remaining exemption classes apply not only when the property is unoccupied, but also when certain categories of people are living there:

Other classes existed historically and are no longer mandatory.  Councils may still offer 100% discount; some discount or no discount at all at their discretion.  Once a property has been vacant for over 2 years, they have the right to levy a surcharge of up to an additional 50% on the standard council tax rate for the property.

All persons normally resident in a property are counted for Council Tax liability.  However, certain classes of person are treated as 'disregarded persons'.  Such persons do not count towards occupancy.  If a property is occupied entirely by disregarded persons then it is taxed as an empty property (50% discount) unless it otherwise qualifies for total exemption.

A person is disregarded if they are:
 aged 17 or under (but S above may apply).
 aged 18 and someone is entitled to draw child benefit for them.
 a school or college leaver aged under 20 who left after 30 April in any year (disregarded until 1 November in the same year even if employed and counts toward exemption N above).
 a full-time student on a qualifying course of education (but N above may apply).
 a foreign language assistant on the official British Council programme (but N above may apply as this counts as being a student).
 a spouse, partner or dependent of either of the above two classes who is not a British citizen and is prohibited from working or claiming benefit by the immigration rules (but N above may apply).
 a young person on a government training scheme or in certain kinds of apprenticeship.
 a prisoner or someone who has been detained for deportation or detained under the Mental Health Act.
 someone who is severely mentally impaired (but U above may apply).
 a long-term patient in a hospital or resident in a care home.
 living in a hostel which provides care or treatment because of old-age; physical or mental disability; past or present alcohol or drug dependence; past or present mental illness.
 living in a bail or probation hostel.
 a live-in carer (exemption J may apply to their original home).
 staying in a hostel or night shelter.
 a member of any religious community.
 a member of a visiting armed force.
 a dependent of a member of a visiting armed force.

Statutory discounts

Low occupancy

A fixed discount, currently set at 25%, is available when there are fewer than two residents; this is known as the Single Person Discount. Though it is often concluded that the full Council Tax charge must, therefore, be based on two or more adults being resident at a property, this is not strictly true.

Some people are automatically disregarded when counting the number of residents for this purpose, such as full-time students. The legislation also provides that, to count as a resident of a property, an individual should have the property as their sole or main residence; case law has established that no single test may be used to determine whether this condition is met.

As part of the National Fraud Initiative, every other year, the Audit Commission analyses metadata deriving from council tax accounts together with the full electoral register to produce lists of people it believes should be subjected to an investigation on the basis that there is a risk that a discount is being received when an adult who does not fail to be disregarded is actually resident in the dwelling.

Disabled occupancy

If a property has been adapted to meet the needs of a disabled occupant, then, after applying in writing, and provided the adaptations are of a certain extent, the property will be rebanded to the band immediately below its normal council tax band. If the property was in the lowest council tax band, it will be placed into a Band Z (the band below A).

Discretionary reductions

Under the Welfare Reform Act 2012, local councils were given powers to create new deduction rules for their council tax. These rules are now officially known as Council Tax Reduction schemes, though many councils market them to residents as Council Tax Support; the choice to market the rules as a tax cut, rather than a benefit, may be an ideological one.

These powers are restricted by the Act; the rules cannot be arbitrary, ad-hoc, or targeted at specific individuals. Since these powers replace the former statutory rebate schemes, the government has also restricted the councils from increasing, by more than a certain amount, the net Council Tax bill for any individual who previously received a rebate. In particular people in receipt of the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit must continue to receive a 100% discount (that is, a council tax bill of £0).

These powers took effect in April 2013. The consequent reduction rules vary from one local authority to another, with some councils keeping the same rules as the rebate schemes they replace, while others took the opportunity to levy a small level of tax on people with low incomes.

Former statutory rebates
Historically, a number of statutory Council Tax rebates existed. These were applied to the Council Tax bill in advance of the bill being delivered to the claimant, effectively creating a discount. However, this was not merely an overly-bureaucratic discount; the rebate money was provided by central government, but the Council Tax bill it rebated was paid to the local authority.

Though the funding was provided by central government, the schemes were administered by the local authority responsible for producing the relevant Council Tax bill. Originally using paper application forms, local authorities began to use a telephone-based application process, in the last few years of the rebate schemes. Under these latter application schemes, claimants would often contact the responsible central government department, who would then forward the details to the local authority.

Since 2013, explicit Council Tax discounts have been provided instead. The local authorities have been given the right to choose their own rules for the discounts, within certain bounds, but many local authorities choose to use similar or identical rules to the former statutory rebate schemes.

Second Adult Rebate

Many individuals share their dwelling with members of separate households, who would ordinarily be expected to pay a share of the council tax bill. However, in some cases, it would not be reasonable to expect those other residents to be able to pay a full share; to assist individuals sharing with those residents, a rebate (Second Adult Rebate) was available, as follows:
 25%, if each of the second adults are in receipt of one of
Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance, or
Income Support, or
Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, or
Pension Credit
otherwise, it is based on the combined gross weekly income of all the second adults:
15%, if under £175
7.5%, if between £175 and £227.99
nothing, if £228 or above

Council Tax Benefit

Council Tax Benefit was a means-tested rebate that potentially rebated 100% of a claimant's council tax bill. The rebate would be reduced by a fifth of any qualifying income above a certain level; benefits did not qualify for this calculation, but most other income did. In effect, Council Tax Benefit was a rebate for people with low incomes.

The claimant could not be awarded both Council Tax Benefit and Second Adult Rebate; only the higher of the two, in relation to the claimant's circumstances, would be awarded.

Non-dependant deductions

A non-dependant is a person that the claimant is sharing accommodation with but is not a member of their own household (that is, not a partner, dependant, etc.), such as lodgers or joint tenants. Since it would be reasonable to expect non-dependants to contribute towards the Council Tax bill, Council Tax Benefit was reduced so that it only covered the claimant's hypothetical portion of the Council Tax bill.

However, no reduction was imposed if the claimant or their partner needed substantial care; this qualification was met if, and only if, the claimant was:
Registered blind, or
In receipt of
the Care Component (any rate) of Disability Living Allowance, or
Severe Disablement Allowance, or
Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance

No contribution was expected from non-dependant who would themselves qualify for Council Tax benefit, were not counted towards the number of residents liable for council tax (for example, due to being a student), were normally resident elsewhere, or were not adults. But the remaining non-dependants were each hypothetically expected to contribute the following amounts:
£2.30 if in part-time work, otherwise
£2.30 if weekly income is under £178
£4.60 if weekly income is between £178 and £305.99
£5.80 if weekly income is between £306 and £381.99
£6.95 if weekly income is over £382

Council Tax Benefit was therefore reduced by an amount equal to these hypothetically expected contributions.

Criticism

London

A report from the IPPR, funded by Trust for London, called for significant reform of the Council Tax system in London. The report called for Council Tax to be devolved to London, for exemptions for second and empty homes to be brought to an end and for Council Tax to be replaced with a property tax which is proportional to the present-day value of homes.

Collection of unpaid tax

Scotland
In Scotland, criticism has been levied not so much at the principle of the tax, but at its debt collection arrangements: Community Charge and Council Tax debts can be pursued up to 40 years later – few people will have conserved their payment receipts for such a long time and as such are unable to prove that they paid. Under Scottish Law, it is the responsibility of the tax payer to prove that the tax has been paid, not for the council to prove that it has not.  John Wilson MSP presented an Enforcement of Local Tax Arrears (Scotland) Bill on 19 March 2010 in order to try to reduce this collection time from 20 to 5 years.  Although Wilson's bill has not made any progress (), the Scottish parliament has passed the Community Charge Debt (Scotland) Bill to stop Councils pursuing debts from the older Community Charge, though there are some scrutiny stages to go through before it can become law.

England and Wales
The ability to collect Council Tax debt, in line with other debts, expires six years after the amount become due unless a liability order has been granted by a magistrates' court. This six-year limit is specifically included in legislation via regulation 34(3) of the Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992. Once a liability order has been granted then, unlike Scotland, there is no limit in legislation as to how long the Council Tax arrears remain outstanding. This allows a local authority to chase debts many years after the original liability order was granted. Councils can garnish wages, send bailiffs to seize property, and imprison people for three months.

Allocation to wrong tax band

An edition of the current affairs programme Tonight with Trevor McDonald on 26 January 2007 investigated whether millions of homes had been placed in the wrong band in the original 1991 valuation.  It was shown that the banding valuations were often done by 'second gear valuations', in other words valuations were often done by driving past homes and allocating bands via a cursory external valuation. The programme followed case studies of a system devised by the presenter Martin Lewis, published on his website in October 2006, who had received thousands back in back payments after appealing their band allocations.  This Council Tax Cashback system was said to have the potential to reach millions and received widespread publicity, likely to encourage people to challenge the system. There had been no information published on how many have been successful in obtaining a reduced banding until 22 November 2008 when the Daily Telegraph, in a news article about the campaign by Martin Lewis, stated that in the past year 97,563 properties in England and Wales have been rebanded, with 69,695 of those down-graded.

11,"is a 1998 Japanese psychological supernatural horror film directed by Hideo Nakata, based on the 1991 novel by Koji Suzuki. The film stars Nanako Matsushima, Miki Nakatani and Hiroyuki Sanada, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it. It is titled The Ring (stylized as the Ring) in English in Japan and released as Ringu in North America.

Production took approximately nine months. Ring and its sequel Spiral were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, Ring was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups in the Ring franchise, popularized J-horror internationally, and triggered a trend of Western remakes, of which the 2002 American film The Ring has been the only critically successful one.

Plot
During a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a videotape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. Presently, the phone rings, but it turns out to merely be Tomoko's mother. After Masami goes to the toilet, Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is later killed by an unseen presence.

Tomoko’s aunt, journalist Reiko Asakawa, investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko’s funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as hers. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked videotape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.

Taking the threat of death seriously, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ryūji Takayama. Ryūji watches the tape despite Reiko’s concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an Ōshima dialect. Before departing to Oshima for further investigation, Reiko catches her and Ryūji’s six-year-old son Yōichi watching the tape after being told to do so by ‘Tomoko’. In Ōshima, Reiko and Ryūji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by ESP researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko’s brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko’s young daughter Sadako psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko’s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ryūji never received a phone call after watching the tape because he didn't watch it at the cabin in Izu. The pair rush there to investigate, arriving there in the afternoon.

Reiko and Ryūji find a well sealed in the cabin's crawlspace, which they deduce is the same well from the videotape's ending. Through another vision, they learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into the well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape 'recorded' the rage she had projected through nensha. After draining the water, they find Sadako’s remains and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.

The next day, Ryūji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the videotape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ryūji at the time, hears his last minutes over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ryūji did not. Desperate to save Yōichi, Reiko drives to her father’s home with the tape and asks him to do her ""a favour"".

Themes
Critics have discussed Ring'''s preoccupations with Japanese tradition's collision with modernity. Colette Balmain identifies: ""In the figure of Sadako, Ring [utilises the] vengeful yūrei archetype of conventional Japanese horror"". She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which ""embodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself"".

Ruth Goldberg argues that Ring expresses ""ambivalence about motherhood"". She reads Reiko as a mother who – due to the new potential for women's independence – neglects her ""natural"" role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a doubling effect whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.

Jay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on. Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.

Production

After the moderate success of the novel Ring, written by Koji Suzuki and published in 1991, publisher Kadokawa Shoten decided to make a motion picture adaptation of Ring.

Screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director Hideo Nakata collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki's novel and watching Fuji Television's 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa. The broadcast version of the 1995 film was re-edited and released on home video under a new title, Ring: Kanzenban ( ""Ring: The Complete Edition""; Nakata did not state which version of it he and Takahashi watched.

In their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist's gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child's gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).

With the budget of US$1.2 million, the entire production took nine months and one week. According to director Nakata, the script and pre-production process took three or four months, shooting five weeks and post-production four months.

The special effects on the cursed videotape and some parts in the film were shot on a 35 mm film which was passed on to a laboratory in which a computer added a ""grainy"" effect. Extended visual effects were used in the part in which the ghost of Sadako Yamamura climbs out of the television. First, they shot the kabuki actress Rie Inoo walking backwards in a jerky, exaggerated motion. They then played the film in reverse to portray an unnatural-looking walk for Sadako.

ReleaseRing was released in Japan on January 31, 1998 where it was distributed by Toho. Upon release in Japan, Ring became the highest-grossing horror film in the country. The film was shown at the 1999 Fantasia Film Festival where it won the first place award for Best Feature in the Asian films section.

Box office
In Japan, the film earned a distribution income (rentals) of  in 1998, making it one of the top ten highest-grossing Japanese films of the year. The film grossed a total Japanese box office revenue of  ().Variety stated that Ring's ""most notable success"" has been in Hong Kong, where it became the biggest grosser during the first half of the year, beating popular American films such as The Matrix. On its 1999 Hong Kong release, Ring earned  (US$4.03 million) during its two-month theatrical run making it Hong Kong's highest-grossing Japanese-language film. This record was later beaten by Stand By Me Doraemon in 2015. In Taiwan, where it released in 1999, the film grossed  ().

In France, the film sold 94,257 tickets, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately  (). In South Korea, 56,983 tickets were sold in the capital city of Seoul, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately  (). The film also grossed $59,001 in Chile and the United Kingdom, adding up to an estimated worldwide gross revenue of approximately .

Home mediaRing was released directly to home video in the United States and Canada by DreamWorks with English, Spanish, and French subtitles on March 4, 2003, under the transliterated title Ringu.

To coincide with its 20th anniversary, Arrow Films under their Arrow Video imprint issued a Blu-ray Disc of Ring on March 18, 2019 in the UK and Ireland. Additionally, a Blu-ray box set featuring Ring, the sequels Spiral and Ring 2, and prequel Ring 0, was also released. The transfer features a 4K resolution restoration that was scanned from the film's original camera negative. The picture grading and restoration, which took place at Imagica Labs in Tokyo, was supervised and approved by Ring cinematographer Jun'ichirō Hayashi. Both Arrow's single Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray box set were later released in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2019, again under the transliterated title Ringu.

Reception

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on 38 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.5 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads: ""Ringu combines supernatural elements with anxieties about modern technology in a truly frightening and unnerving way"".Sight & Sound critic Mark Kermode praised the film's ""timeless terror"", with its ""combination of old folk devils and contemporary moral panics"" which appeal to both teen and adult audiences alike. While Adam Smith of Empire Online finds the film ""throttled by its over complexity, duff plotting and a distinct lack of actual action"", Kermode emphasizes that ""one is inclined to conclude that it is the telling, rather than the content of the tale, that is all-important"". Variety agrees that the slow pace, with ""its gradual evocation of evil lying await beneath the surface of normality"", is one of the film's biggest strengths. Ring was listed as the twelfth best horror film of all time by The Guardian and also picked by Stuart Heritage in the same paper as the film that frightened him most.Ring was ranked No. 69 in Empire magazine's ""The 100 Best Films of World Cinema"" in 2010. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Ring placed at number 61 on their top 100 list.

Influence
The international success of the Japanese films launched a revival of horror filmmaking in Japan that resulted in such pictures as Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 2001 film Pulse (known as  in Japan), Takashi Shimizu's  (2000), Hideo Nakata's , also based on a short story by Suzuki), and Higuchinsky's Uzumaki (2000, a.k.a. Vortex, based on the Junji Ito horror manga of the same name).

Influence on Western cinemaRing had some influence on Western cinema and gained cult status in the West.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hollywood horror had largely been dominated by the slasher sub-genre, which relied on on-screen violence, shock tactics, and gore. Ring, whose release in Japan roughly coincided with The Blair Witch Project in the United States, helped to revitalise the genre by taking a more restrained approach to horror, leaving much of the terror to the audience's imagination. The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term J-Horror in the West. This ""New Asian Horror"" resulted in further successful releases, such as Ju-on: The Grudge and Dark Water. In addition to Japanese productions this boom also managed to bring attention to similar films made in East Asia at the same time such as (A Tale of Two Sisters) from South Korea and (The Eye) from Hong Kong.

All of these films were later remade in English. Released in 2002, The Ring reached number 1 at the box office and grossed slightly more in Japan than the original. The original Ring grossed  in 1998, while The Ring remake grossed  in 2002.

Sequels and remake

The original sequel was Spiral, but due to its poor reception, a new sequel, Ring 2, was released in 1999 which continued the storyline of this film. It was followed by a 2000 prequel, Ring 0: Birthday, followed by Sadako in 2019. Spiral in turn was followed by Sadako 3D in 2012 and Sadako 3D 2 in 2013.

A television series, Ring: The Final Chapter, was made, with a similar storyline but many changes in characters and their backstories. An American remake, The Ring, was made in 2002.

12,"Joseph T. ""Cap"" Shaw (1874–1952) was the editor of Black Mask magazine from 1926 to 1936.
Prior to becoming Black Mask editor, Shaw had worked as a newspaper reporter and as a soldier in World War I, attaining the
rank of captain (Shaw's friends gave him the nickname ""Cap"").
 Shaw was also a professional fencer,
and even won an Olympic medal for his fencing ability.
 Under his editorship, Black Mask published many works of crime fiction now recognised as classics of the genre, by authors such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler,
and Erle Stanley Gardner.

Chandler greatly admired Shaw's ability to encourage Black Mask writers, claiming in a letter,
""We wrote better for him than we could have written for anybody else"".

Despite Black Mask's critical and commercial popularity, Shaw was eventually fired from the magazine, succeeded by Fanny Ellsworth. Shaw then
worked as a literary agent, though without notable success.

14,"A constituent assembly (also known as a constitutional convention, constitutional congress, or constitutional assembly) is a body assembled for the purpose of drafting or revising a constitution. Members of a constituent assembly may be elected by popular vote, drawn by sortition, appointed, or some combination of these methods. Assemblies are typically considered distinct from a regular legislature, although members of the legislature may compose a significant number of its members.  As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state's normal legislative procedures; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved. A constituent assembly is a form of representative democracy.

Unlike forms of constitution-making in which a constitution is unilaterally imposed by a sovereign lawmaker, the constituent assembly creates a constitution through ""internally imposed"" actions, in that members of the constituent assembly are themselves citizens, but not necessarily the political leaders, of the country for which they are creating a constitution. As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster:

""Constitutions arise in a number of different ways.  At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum, we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations.  At the democratic extreme, we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution.  And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements.""

By Country

Australia 
Australia held four constitutional conventions, one each in 1891, 1897, 1973, and 1998

Chile 

As of May 2021 Chile is the most recently elected constitutional assembly. The 155 members of this assembly were elected between 15 and 16 May 2021. The assembly has gender parity (50% females and 50% males) and has 17 seats reserved for people belonging to indigenous peoples. The assembly is granted 12 months to draft a new constitution, which has to be ratified by referendum once written.

Costa Rica 

Immediately after the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War that overthrew the Rafael Angel Calderón Government, the leaders of the victorious side called for the election of a Constituent Assembly in the same year. The Assembly successfully drafted and approved the current Costa Rican Constitution.

Denmark

The Danish Constituent Assembly established the Constitution of Denmark in 1849.

European Union 
The European Convention (2001)  drafted the Constitution for Europe for approval by the European Council and ratification by the member states. This constitution was abandoned after being rejected in French and Dutch referenda, and was replaced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007

France 

During the French Revolution (from July 1789 to September 1791) a National Constituent Assembly () was formed when representatives assembled at the only location available – a tennis court – and swore the Tennis Court Oath on June 20, 1789, promising that they would not adjourn until they had drafted a new constitution for France. Louis XVI recognized the validity of the National Constituent Assembly on June 27, 1789.

Germany 
Parlamentarischer Rat (Parliamentary Council) (1948) – Drafted the Basic Law of the Federal Republic for ratification by the Länder. This council was not recognized as legitimate by Soviet-occupied East Germany, which drafted its own constitution in 1949 and would not accept the Basic Law until German reunification in 1990.

Iceland 
On 27 November 2010, Iceland held an election for a constitutional assembly, with 522 people competing for 25 delegate seats. The assembly, in session for four months from early April until late July 2011, drafted a new constitution and passed it unanimously with 25 votes and no abstentions. On 20 October 2012 the parliament put the bill to a national referendum, in which 67% of the voters supported the bill. Further, 67% of the voters supported equal voting rights (one person, one vote) and 83% supported national ownership of natural resources, two key provisions of the bill. Parliament has failed to ratify the bill, however, inviting accusations that the political class is trying to thwart the will of the people by disrespecting the result of the 2012 constitutional referendum.

Ireland 
In Ireland, the government elected in March 2011 has committed to establishing a ""constitutional convention"" to recommend constitutional amendments on six specified issues and others it may consider; the government has separately promised amendments on five other issues.

India 

The Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India, and served as its first Parliament as an independent nation. It was set up as a result of negotiations between the leaders of the Indian independence movement and members of the British Cabinet Mission. The constituent assembly was elected indirectly by the members of the Provincial legislative assembly, which existed under the British Raj. It first met on December 9, 1946, in Delhi. On August 15, 1947, India became an independent nation, and the Constituent Assembly started functioning as India's Parliament. B. R. Ambedkar drafted the Constitution of India in conjunction with the requisite deliberations and debates in the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly approved the Constitution on November 26, 1949 (celebrated as Constitution Day), and it took effect on January 26, 1950 — a day now commemorated as Republic Day in India. Once the Constitution took effect, the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India.

Indonesia 

The Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia was established to draw up a permanent constitution. Its membership was elected in November 1955, and it met for the first time in November 1956. After four sessions, it failed to agree on the fundamental basis for the state. It was dissolved in 1959, and the original constitution imposed by presidential decree.(OTP)

Italy

The Constituent Assembly of Italy was established in 1946 in the wake of Fascist Italy's defeat during World War II. It was elected with universal suffrage, simultaneously with a referendum about the adoption of Republic or the continuation of monarchy. Voters chose Republic, and the new assembly had the task to approve the new republic governments, as well as to write a new constitution. This was approved on 22 December 1947.

It was dissolved on 31 January 1948, to be replaced by the new Parliament of Italy.

Mexico 
The Viceroyalty of New Spain sent deputies to the Cortes of Cadiz, which enacted the 1812 Constitution. By the time this Constitution was enacted, an insurgency fighting for independence from Spain was already established.

The first Constituent Congress of independent Mexico, known as the Congress of Anahuac, was first gathered in Chilpancingo whilst the war of independence was still ongoing. During the opening of Congress, José María Morelos outlined its program in a document called Sentimientos de la Nación (Feelings of the Nation), which was the first antecedent of the varios Constitutions of Mexico. Being persecuted by royalist troops, the Congress fled Chilpancingo and gathered in Apatzingán.

On October 22, 1814, the Congress enacted the Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of Mexican America (Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana), known as the Constitution of Apatzingán. The 1814 Constitution entered into force in the territories dominated by the insurgents, but as the war continued and the first insurgent leaders (like Morelos) were defeated, it was largely forgotten.

After independence was consummated on September 27, 1821, and based on the Plan de Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba, the Provisional Governing Junta was stablished. The Junta proclaimed the Act of Independence of the Mexican Empire and acted as a de facto legislative assembly until February 24, 1822, when the Constituent Congress was gathered. On May 19, 1822, the Constituent Congress proclaimed Agustín de Iturbide as Emperor. The relations between Emperor and Congress were always problematic, a situation that led to the dissolution of Congress by Iturbide on October 31, 1822, without a formal Constitution being enacted.

After the dissolution of Congress, Iturbide created the National Instituent Junta, which enacted the Provisional Political Bylaws of the Mexican Empire on December 18, 1822. The dissolution of Congress had resulted in an armed revolution under the Plan de Casa Mata, which called for the establishment of a Federal Republic and for the restoration of the Constituent Congress. Iturbide was forced to abdicate and he reinstalled the Constituent Congress.

The Congress then created a provisional government, called the Triumvirate, and enacted the Constituent Act of the Mexican Federation, by which the former Provinces of Mexico were transformed into free and sovereign States. After this, a Constituent Congress was formed with the participation of the States and it enacted the 1824 Constitution.

Many disputes aroused between federalists and centralists, which resulted in political instability and in 1836 the Siete Leyes (Seven Laws) were enacted. The Siete Leyes dissolved the federation and created a unitary republic, but that ended in 1846 when the Constitutive and Reforms Act was enacted and the 1824 Constitution, and thus the federation, was restored.

On October 16, 1854, President Juan Álvarez, under the Plan de Ayutla, decreed the formation of another Constituent Congress, which met in 1856. During the presidency of Ignacio Comonfort, the Constituent Congress enacted the 1857 Constitution, which was liberal in character. The Constitution was not well-received by the church and Mexican conservatives, and the Plan de Tacubaya called for its derogation. This events led to the Reform War, which the liberals won, then restoring the 1857 Constitution and adding to it the Reform Laws.

After the Porfiriato, and whilst the Mexican Revolution was still being fought, President Venustiano Carranza formed a Constituent Congress, which met in Querétaro and enacted the still-current Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917.

Nepal 

Nepal had two Constituent assemblies, the last one being elected after its predecessor failed to deliver a constitution, despite multiple extensions. It also served as the country's parliament.
Finally Nepal had made constitution with 89% majority. Nepal has adopted Federalism since.

Poland 
The Great Sejm (also known as Four-Year Sejm) was held between 1788 and 1792. Its principal aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth politically and economically. These attempts were made by writing Constitution of 3 May 1791 that was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The constitution did not go into effect because of the Polish-Russian War of 1792 and the Third Partition of Poland.

Philippines 
The Philippines has had several conventions:

 1898 - drafted the 1898 Malolos Constitution, the basic law of the First Philippine Republic, the first constitutional republic in Asia.  The drafted constitution was written by Felipe Calderón y Roca and Felipe Buencamino as an alternative to a pair of proposals to the Malolos Congress by Apolinario Mabini and Pedro Paterno. After a lengthy debate in the latter part of 1898, it was enacted on 21 January 1899.
 1935 – to draft a constitution to create the autonomous Commonwealth of the Philippines under the U.S. Tydings–McDuffie Act. The constitution was also used in the 3rd Republic (1946) until the passage of the 1973 constitution. Members were elected through the 1934 Philippine Constitutional Convention election
 1971 – to draft a revised constitution to replace the old U.S. 1935 Philippine constitution. Members were elected through the 1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election. The system of government changed from presidential to parliamentary to presidential-parliamentary (in 1984 amendment). The constitution lasted until the downfall of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Corazon Aquino appointed members to draft the 1987 Constitution through a Constitutional Commission.

Russia 

The Russian Constituent Assembly was established in Russia in the wake of the October Revolution of 1917 to form a new constitution after the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government.

Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan Parliament approved the creation of a Sri Lankan Constitutional Assembly on March 9, 2016 proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. The assembly will draft a new constitution for Sri Lanka.

Turkey
Constituent Assembly of Turkey was established in 1961 after the 1960 Turkish coup d'état to prepare a democratic constitution. The constitution was prepared and approved by the voters in a referendum of 1961.

United States

Federal

The U.S. Constitutional Convention  drafted the still-current United States Constitution in 1787.  Its delegates were appointed by the states, not directly elected, and not all states sent delegates; moreover, the Convention was originally charged with drafting amendments to the Articles of Confederation rather than a new constitution.

The US Constitution contains no provision for its own replacement (and because of the presence of entrenched clauses it cannot be revoked through an amendment). Article V of the Constitution does permit Congress to appoint a national constitutional convention to propose amendments but it has never done so. While Congress has the option to submit both its own proposals for amendments and those of a national convention to state conventions rather than the state legislatures for ratification; this process has been used only once (for the Twenty-first Amendment).

States

A long tradition in the use of constituent assemblies exists at the state level of Constitutionalism. In fact, constituent assemblies met in the states before the formation of the Federal Constitution in 1787 as well as after its ratification. Since 1776 nearly 150 state constitutional conventions have met to draft or revise state constitutions.

These early state constitutional conventions frequently did not use procedural steps like popular ratification that became commonplace in the mid-19th century.  Yet they were considered to be constituent assemblies that exercised their authority as that of the people. As American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War by Christian G. Fritz notes:.
""A legitimate constitution depended on whether the sovereign people authorized it, not whether a particular procedure was used or whether revolutionary conventions were free of other responsibilities, such as passing ordinary legislation. It was the people as the sovereign who authorized drafting those first [state] constitutions that gave them their legitimacy, not whether they used procedures that matched what was later understood to be necessary to create fundamental law."" 

American state constituent assemblies in the 19th and 20th centuries reflected many qualities of a citizen's movement.  From the start of state American constitution-making, delegates to constitutional conventions studied earlier state models of constitutions.  They often self-consciously ""borrow[ed]"" constitutional text and provisions from other states.  They often used in their drafting and debates compact and pocket-sized compilations of all the existing American constitutions, so that the constituent's assembly could draw upon the latest in constitutional design. The powers of these state constituent assemblies were also highly contested, with some claiming that they had unlimited legal power and others claiming that they must operate within the pre-existing legal landscape.  In the end, a common law of constituent power emerged which held that elected constituent assemblies had limited powers.

Several U.S. states have held multiple conventions over the years to change their particular state's constitutions.

 Missouri has held four, in 1820, 1865, 1875 and 1945.
 Michigan has held four, in 1835, 1850, 1908 and 1963.
 Massachusetts has held six, in 1778, 1779–80, 1820–21, 1853, 1917–18, and most recently 2016.
 The Constitution of New York has been amended, or re-established de novo, through nine Constitutional Conventions: in 1776–1777, 1801, 1821, 1846, 1867–1868, 1894, 1915, 1938, and 1967; a Constitutional Commission in 1872–1873; and a Judicial Convention in 1921.
 Vermont's first constitution was drafted by a convention that met in July 1777 and revised by a convention that met in 1786, both of these conventions occurring when Vermont was still independent of the United States. Vermont was admitted into the United States in 1791 and its government continued to function under the 1786 constitution. Two years later in 1793 held another convention to bring some provisions of its constitution into line with the Constitution of the United States.
 Virginia Conventions have included six unlimited meetings. Constitutions were promulgated by fiat in 1776, 1864 and 1901–02, and ratified by referendum in 1829–30, 1850, and 1868. Limited Conventions and Constitutional Commissions resulting in revisions were held in 1927, 1945, 1956 and 1968. Subsequently, the state legislature proposes amendments that are ratified in popular referendum.

State Constitutional Conventions 
All 50 states have had a Constitutional Convention, numbering at least 230 in total.

Countries without an entrenched constitution
A few countries do not have an entrenched constitution which can be amended by normal legislative procedures; the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel are examples. In these countries there is no need to call constituent assemblies, and no provision to do so, as the legislature can effectively modify the constitution.

Although it lacks a written constitution, the United Kingdom has had several conventions at the subnational level including:

 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–1976) – a failed attempt to find a solution to the status of Northern Ireland.
 Scottish Constitutional Convention (1989) – produced a plan for Scottish devolution.

The constitution of New Zealand consists of a collection of statutes (Acts of Parliament), Treaties, Orders-in-Council, Letters Patent, decisions of the Courts and unwritten constitutional conventions. Because it is not supreme law, the constitution is comparatively easy to reform, requiring only a majority of Members of Parliament to amend it.

The constitutional law of Israel is determined by the Knesset which, since 1949, serves as the country's ongoing constituent assembly. The Knesset has the power to create Basic Laws of Israel, laws which are entrenched legislation and will become part of a ""future"" constitution of Israel, as well as ""regular"" statutory legislation.

15,"Pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit, Pāli: paṭiccasamuppāda), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key doctrine in Buddhism shared by all schools of Buddhism. It states that all dharmas (phenomena) arise in dependence upon other dharmas: ""if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist"". The basic principle is that all things (dharmas, phenomena, principles) arise in dependence upon other things.

The doctrine includes depictions of the arising of suffering (anuloma-paṭiccasamuppāda, ""with the grain"", forward conditionality) and depictions of how the chain can be reversed (paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda, ""against the grain"", reverse conditionality). These processes are expressed in various lists of dependently originated phenomena, the most well-known of which is the twelve links or nidānas (Pāli: dvādasanidānāni, Sanskrit: dvādaśanidānāni). The traditional interpretation of these lists is that they describe the process of a sentient being's rebirth in saṃsāra, and the resultant duḥkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness), and they provide an analysis of rebirth and suffering that avoids positing an atman (unchanging self or eternal soul). The reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the cessation of rebirth (and thus, the cessation of suffering).

Another interpretation regards the lists as describing the arising of mental processes and the resultant notion of ""I"" and ""mine"" that leads to grasping and suffering. Several modern western scholars argue that there are inconsistencies in the list of twelve links, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists and elements, some of which can be traced to the Vedas.

The doctrine of dependent origination appears throughout the early Buddhist texts. It is the main topic of the Nidana Samyutta of the Theravada school's Saṃyuttanikāya (henceforth SN). A parallel collection of discourses also exists in the Chinese Saṁyuktāgama (henceforth SA).

Overview
Dependent origination is a philosophically complex concept, subject to a large variety of explanations and interpretations. As the interpretations often involve specific aspects of dependent origination, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive to each other.

Dependent origination can be contrasted with the classic Western concept of causation in which an action by one thing is said to cause a change in another thing. Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few.

The principle of dependent origination has a variety of philosophical implications.

 As an ontological principle (i.e., as a metaphysical concept about the nature of existence), it holds that all phenomena arise from other, pre-existing phenomena, and in turn current phenomena condition future phenomena. As such, everything in the world has been produced by causes. Traditionally, this is also closely connected to the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth, and how rebirth occurs without a fixed self or soul, but as a process conditioned by various phenomena and their relations.
 As an epistemological principle (i.e., as a theory about knowledge), it holds that there are no permanent and stable things (though nirvana can sometimes be seen as an exception to this). Because everything is dependently originated, nothing is permanent (hence the Buddhist concept of impermanence, anicca) and nothing has a completely independent self or essence (hence the Buddhist concept of no-self, anatta). Consequently, all phenomena and experiences lack independent identity. In various traditions, this is closely associated with the doctrine of emptiness (śūnyatā).
 As a phenomenological or psychological principle, it refers to the workings of the mind and how suffering, craving, and self-view arise. This can refer to how different mental states condition each other over time, or to how different mental phenomena condition each other in a single moment.

Etymology
Pratītyasamutpāda consists of two terms:

 Pratītya: ""having depended."" The term appears in the Vedas and Upanishads in the sense of ""confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin"". The Sanskrit root of the word is prati* whose forms appear more extensively in the Vedic literature, and it means ""to go towards, go back, come back, to approach"" with the connotation of ""observe, learn, convince oneself of the truth of anything, be certain of, believe, give credence, recognize"". In other contexts, a related term pratiti* means ""going towards, approaching, insight into anything"".
 Samutpāda: ""arising"", ""rise, production, origin"" In Vedic literature, it means ""spring up together, arise, come to pass, occur, effect, form, produce, originate"".

Pratītyasamutpāda has been translated into English as dependent origination, dependent arising, interdependent co-arising, conditioned arising, and conditioned genesis.

Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to pratītyasamutpāda are apekṣhasamutpāda and prāpyasamutpāda.

The term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, Pali: dvādasanidānāni, Sanskrit: dvādaśanidānāni, from dvāvaśa (""twelve"") + nidānāni (plural of ""nidāna"", ""cause, motivation, link""). Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, pratityasamutpada (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, paticcasamuppāda (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.

Dependent origination in early Buddhism

The principle of conditionality
In the early Buddhist texts, the basic principle of conditionality is called by different names such as “the certainty (or law) of dhamma” (dhammaniyāmatā), “suchness of dharma” (法如; *dharmatathatā), the “enduring principle” (ṭhitā dhātu), “specific conditionality” (idappaccayatā) and “dhammic nature” (法爾; dhammatā). This principle is expressed in its most general form as follows:

According to Paul Williams ""this is what causation is for early Buddhist thought. It is a relationship between events, and is what we call it when if X occurs Y follows, and when X does not occur Y does not follow."" Richard Gombrich writes that this basic principle that ""things happen under certain conditions"" means that the Buddha understood experiences as ""processes subject to causation."" Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that specific conditionality ""is a relationship of indispensability and dependency: the indispensability of the condition (e.g. birth) to the arisen state (e.g. aging and death), the dependency of the arisen state upon its condition.""

Peter Harvey states this means that ""nothing (except nirvāna) is independent. The doctrine thus complements the teaching that no permanent, independent self can be found."" Ajahn Brahm argues that the grammar of the above passage indicates that one feature of the Buddhist principle of causality is that ""there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect. It is a mistake to assume that the effect follows one moment after its cause, or that it appears simultaneously with its cause.""

Variable phenomena, invariant principle
According to the Paccaya sutta (SN 12.20 and its parallel in SA 296), dependent origination is the basic principle of conditionality which is at play in all conditioned phenomena. This principle is invariable and stable, while the “dependently arisen processes” (paṭiccasamuppannā dhammā) are variable and impermanent.

Pater Harvey argues that there is a ""overall Basic Pattern that is Dhamma"" within which ""specific basic patterns (dhammas) flow into and nurture each other in complex, but set, regular patterns."".

Invariant principle
According to the Paccaya sutta (SN 12.20) and its parallel, this natural law of this/that conditionality is independent of being discovered by a Buddha (a ""Tathāgata""), just like the laws of physics. The Paccaya sutta states that whether or not there are Buddhas who see it ""this elemental fact (dhātu, or “principle”) just stands (thitā), this basic-pattern-stability (dhamma-tthitatā), this basic-pattern-regularity (dhamma-niyāmatā): specific conditionality (idappaccayatā).""

Bhikkhu Sujato translates the basic description of the stability of dependent origination as ""the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise"". The Chinese parallel at SA 296 similarly states that dependent origination is ""the constancy of dharmas, the certainty of dharmas, suchness of dharmas, no departure from the true, no difference from the true, actuality, truth, reality, non-confusion"". According to Harvey, these passages indicate that conditionality is ""a principle of causal regularity, a Basic Pattern (Dhamma) of things"" which can be discovered, understood and then transcended.

Variable phenomena - dependently arisen processes 
The principle of conditionality, which is real and stable, is contrasted with the ""dependently arisen processes"", which are described as ""impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, of a nature to be destroyed, of a nature to vanish, of a nature to fade away, of a nature to cease."" SA 296 describes them simply as ""arising thus according to causal condition, these are called dharmas arisen by causal condition.""

Conditionality and liberation

The Buddha's discovery of conditionality
Regarding the arising of suffering, SN 12.10 discusses how before the Buddha's awakening, he searched for the escape from suffering as follows: ""when what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?"", discovering the chain of conditions as expressed in the twelve nidanas and other lists. MN 26 also reports that after the Buddha's awakening, he considered that dependent origination was one of the two principles which were ""profound (gambhira), difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of mere reasoning (atakkāvacara), subtle."" The other principle which is profound and difficult to see is said to be Nirvana, ""the stopping, or transcending, of conditioned co-arising"" (Harvey).

In the Mahānidānasutta (DN 15) the Buddha states that dependent origination is ""deep and appears deep"", and that it is ""because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching"" that people become ""tangled like a ball of string"" in views (diṭṭhis), samsara, rebirth and suffering. SN 12.70 and its counterpart SA 347 state that “knowledge of Dhamma-stability"" (dhamma-tthiti-ñānam) comes first, then comes knowledge of nirvana (nibbane-ñānam). However, while the process which leads to nirvāna is conditioned, nirvāna itself is called “unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconstructed” (Ud. 80–1). The Milinda Panha compares to how a mountain is not dependent on the path that leads to it (Miln. 269)"". According to Harvey, since it is ""not co-arisen (asamuppana) (It. 37–8), nirvāna is not something that is conditionally arisen, but is the stopping of all such processes.""

Seeing the dharma
MN 28 associates knowing dependent origination with knowing the dharma:

A well-known early exposition of the basic principle of causality is said to have led to the stream entry of Sariputta and Moggallāna. This ye dharmā hetu phrase, which appears in the Vinaya (Vin.I.40) and other sources, states:Of those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathagata has stated the cause, and also their cessation.A similar phrase is uttered by Kondañña, the first convert to realize awakening at the end of the first sermon given by the Buddha: ""whatever is of a nature to arise (samudaya dhamma) is all of a nature to pass away (nirodha dhamma).""

Application

Conditionality as the middle way - not-self and emptiness 
The early Buddhist texts also associate dependent arising with emptiness and not-self. The early Buddhist texts outline different ways in which dependent origination is a middle way between different sets of ""extreme"" views (such as ""monist"" and ""pluralist"" ontologies or materialist and dualist views of mind-body relation). In the Kaccānagottasutta (SN 12.15, parallel at SA 301), the Buddha states that ""this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence"" and then explains the right view as follows:

The Kaccānagottasutta then places the teaching of dependent origination (listing the twelve nidanas in forward and reverse order) as a middle way which rejects these two ""extreme"" metaphysical views which can be seen as two mistaken conceptions of the self.

According to Hùifēng, a recurring theme throughout the Nidānasamyutta (SN 12) is the Buddha's ""rejection of arising from any one or other of the four categories of self, other, both or neither (non-causality)."" A related statement can be found in the Paramārtha­śūnyatāsūtra (Dharma Discourse on Ultimate Emptiness, SĀ 335, parallel at EĀ 37:7), which states that when a sense organ arises ""it does not come from any location...it does not go to any location"", as such it is said to be ""unreal, yet arises; and on having arisen, it ends and ceases."" Furthermore this sutra states that even though ""there is action (karma) and result (vipāka)"" there no ""no actor agent"" (kāraka). It also states that dharmas of dependent origination are classified as conventional.

The Kaccānagottasutta and its parallel also associates understanding dependent origination with avoiding views of a self (atman). This text states that if ""you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion ‘my self’, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing."" Similarly, the Mahānidānasutta (DN 15) associates understanding dependent origination with abandoning various wrongs views about a self, while failing to understand it is associated becoming entangled in these views. Another sutra, SĀ 297, states that dependent origination is ""the Dharma Discourse on Great Emptiness,"" and then proceeds to refute numerous forms of “self-view” (ātmadṛṣṭi).

SN 12:12 (parallel at SĀ 372) the Buddha is asked a series of questions about the self (who feels? who craves? etc.), the Buddha states that these questions are invalid, and instead teaches dependent origination. SĀ 80 also discuss an important meditative attainment called the emptiness concentration (śūnyatā­samādhi) which in this text is associated contemplating how phenomena arise due to conditions and are subject to cessation.

The four noble truths
According to early suttas like AN 3.61, the second and third noble truths of the four noble truths are directly correlated to the principle of dependent origination. The second truth applies dependent origination in a direct order, while the third truth applies it in inverse order. Furthermore, according to SN 12.28, the noble eight-fold path (the fourth noble truth) is the path which leads to the cessation of the twelve links of dependent origination and as such is the “best of all conditioned states” (AN.II.34). Therefore, according to Harvey, the four noble truths ""can be seen as an application of the principle of conditioned co-arising focused particularly on dukkha.""

Lists of nidanas 
In the early Buddhist texts, dependent origination is analyzed and expressed in various lists of dependently originated phenomena (dhammas) or causes (nidānas). Nidānas are co-dependent principles, processes or events, which act as links on a chain, conditioning and depending on each other. When certain conditions are present, they give rise to subsequent conditions, which in turn give rise to other conditions. Phenomena are sustained only so long as their sustaining factors remain.

The most common one is a list of twelve causes (Pali: dvādasanidānāni, Sanskrit: dvādaśanidānāni). Bucknell refers to it as the ""standard list"". It is found in section 12 of the Samyutta Nikaya and its parallels, as well as in other suttas belonging to other Nikayas and Agamas. This list also appears in Mahasamghika texts like the Salistamba Sutra and in (later) works like Abhidharma texts and Mahayana sutras. According to Eviatar Shulman, ""the 12 links are paticcasamuppada,"" which is a process of mental conditioning. Cox notes that even though the early scriptures contain numerous variations of lists, the 12 factor list became the standard list in the later Abhidharma and Mahayana treatises.

The most common interpretation of the twelve cause list in the traditional exegetical literature is that the list is describing the conditional arising of rebirth in saṃsāra, and the resultant duḥkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). An alternative Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of ""I"" and ""mine,"" which are the source of suffering.

Understanding the relationships between these phenomena is said to lead to nibbana, complete freedom from the cyclical rebirth cycles of samsara. Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the cessation of mental formations and rebirth. Alex Wayman notes that ""according to Buddhist tradition, Gautama discovered this formula during the night of Enlightenment and by working backward from ""old age and death"" in the reverse of the arising order."" Wayman also writes that ""in time, the twelve members were depicted on the rim of a wheel representing samsara.""

Lists of nidanas

The twelve nidanas 
The popular listing of twelve nidānas is found in numerous sources. In some of the early texts, the nidānas themselves are defined and subjected to analysis (vibhaṅga). The explanations of the nidānas can be found in the Pali SN 12.2 (Vibhaṅga ""Analysis"" sutta) and in its parallel at SA 298. Further parallels to SN 12.2 can be found at EA 49.5, some Sanskrit parallels such as the Pratītyasamutpādādivibhaṅganirdeśanāmasūtra (The Discourse giving the Explanation and Analysis of Conditional Origination from the Beginning) and a Tibetan translation of this Sanskrit text at Toh 211.

Alternative lists in SN/SA 
The twelve branched list, though popular, is just one of the many lists of dependently originated dharmas which appear in the early sources. According to Analayo, the alternative lists of dependently arisen phenomena are equally valid ""alternative expressions of the same principle.""

Choong notes that some discourses (SN 12.38-40 and SA 359-361) contain only 11 elements, omitting ignorance and starting out from willing (ceteti). SN 12.39 begins with three synonyms for saṅkhāra, willing, intending (pakappeti) and carrying out (anuseti). It then states that ""this becomes an object (arammanam) for the persistence of consciousness (viññanassa-thitiya)"" which leads to the appearance of name and form. The standard listing then follows.

SN 12.38 (and the parallel at SA 359) contain a much shorter sequence, it begins with willing as above which leads to consciousness, then following after consciousness it states: ""there is in the future the becoming of rebirth (punabbhavabhinibbatti)"", which leads to ""coming-and-going (agatigati)"", followed by ""decease-and-rebirth (cutupapato)"" and following that ""there arise in the future birth, ageing-and-death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair."" Another short sequence is found at SN 12. 66 and SA 291 which contain an analysis of dependent origination with just three factors: craving (tanha), basis (upadhi, possibly related to upadana), and suffering (dukkha).

In SN 12.59 and its counterpart SA 284, there is a chain that starts by saying that for someone who ""abides in seeing [the Chinese has grasping at] the flavour in enfettering dharmas (saññojaniyesu dhammesu), there comes the appearance (avakkanti) of consciousness."" There then follows the standard list. Then it states that if someone abides by seeing the danger (adinavanupassino) in the dharmas (the Chinese has seeing impermanence), there is no appearance of consciousness (Chinese has mind).

SN 12.65 and 67 (and SA 287 and 288) begin the chain with both consciousness and name and form conditioning each other in a cyclical relationship. It also states that ""consciousness turns back, it goes no further than name and form."" SN 12.67 also contains a chain with consciousness and name and form being in a reciprocal relationship. In this sutta, Sariputta states that this relationship is like two sheaves of reeds leaning on each other for support (the parallel at SA 288 has three sheaves instead).

There are also several passages with chains that begin with the six sense spheres (ayatana). They can be found in SN 12. 24, SA 343, SA 352-354, SN 12. 13-14 and SN 12. 71-81. Another one of these is found in SN 35.106, which is termed the ""branched version"" by Bucknell because it branches off into six classes of consciousness:Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. This is the origin of suffering … [the same formula is repeated with the other six sense bases and six consciousnesses, that is, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind]Other depictions of the chain at SN 12.52 and its parallel at SA 286, begin with seeing the assada (taste; enjoyment; satisfaction) which leads to craving and the rest of the list of nidanas. Meanwhile, in SN 12.62 and SA 290, dependent origination is depicted with just two nidanas, contact (phassa) and feeling (vedana). SN 12.62 says that when one becomes disenchanted with contact and feeling, desire fades away.

Alternative lists in other Nikayas 
The Kalahavivāda Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta (Sn. 862-872) has the following chain of causes (as summarized by Doug Smith):""name-and-form conditions contact, contact conditions feeling, feeling conditions desire, desire conditions clinging, and clinging conditions quarrels, disputes, lamentations, and grief.""Kalahavivādasutta Snp 4.11 (Snp 168), translated by Laurence Khantipalo Mills, https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/mills

Dīgha Nikāya Sutta 1, the Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71 describes six nidānas:

Similarly, the Madhupiṇḍikasutta (MN 18) also contains the following passage:Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate (papañca). What you proliferate about is the source from which a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present. [The same process is then repeated with the other six sense bases.]The Mahānidānasutta (DN 15) and its Chinese parallels such as DA 13 describe a unique version which is dubbed the ""looped version"" by Bucknell (DN 14 also has a similar looped chain but it adds the six sense fields after name and form):Name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.  That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.The Mahahatthipadopama-sutta (M 28) contains another short explanation of dependent origination:these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated. The desire, adherence, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering. Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.

Correlation with the five aggregates
Mathieu Boisvert correlates the middle nidanas (3-10) with the five aggregates. According to Boisvert, the consciousness and feeling aggregates correlate directly with the corresponding nidana, while the rupa aggregate correlates with the six sense objects and contact. The samskara aggregate meanwhile, correlates with nidana #2, as well as craving, clinging and bhava (existence, becoming).

Boisvert notes that while sañña (""perception"" or ""recognition"") is not explicitly found in the twelvefold chain, it would fit in between feeling and craving. This is because unwholesome perceptions (such as delighting in pleasurable feelings) are responsible for the arising of unwholesome samskaras (like craving). Likewise, skillful perceptions (such as focusing on the three marks of existence) lead to wholesome samskaras.

According to Analayo, each of the twelve nidanas ""re-quires all five aggregates to be in existence concurrently."" Furthermore:The teaching on dependent arising does not posit the existence of any of the links in the abstract, but instead show how a particular link, as an aspect of the continuity of the five aggregates, has a conditioning influence on another link. It does not imply that any of these links exist apart from the five aggregates.

Development of the twelve nidanas

Commentary on Vedic cosmogeny

Alex Wayman has argued that the ideas found in the dependent origination doctrine may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and other older Vedic texts.

According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where a cause ""produces an effect because a property or svadha (energy) is inherent in something"" along with alternative ideas of causality, appear extensively in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the Rigveda and the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas.

A similar resemblance has been noted by Joanna Jurewicz, who argues that the first four nidanas resemble the Hymn of Creation (RigVeda X, 12) and other Vedic sources which describe the creation of the cosmos. Jurewicz argues that dependent origination is ""a polemic"" against the Vedic creation myth and that, paradoxically, ""the Buddha extracted the essence of Vedic cosmogony and expressed in explicit language."" Richard Gombrich agrees with this view, and argues that the first four elements of dependent origination are the Buddha's attempt to ""ironize and criticize Vedic cosmogony."" According to Gombrich, while in the Vedic creation theory ""the universe is considered to be grounded on a primordial essence which is endowed with consciousness,"" the Buddha's theory avoids this essence (atman-Bahman).

Jurewicz and Gombrich compare the first nidana, ignorance (avijja), with the stage before creation that is described in the Rigveda's Hymn of Creation. While the term avidya does not actually appear in this Hymn, the pre-creation stage is seen as unknowable and characterized by darkness. According to Gombrich, at this stage ""consciousness is non-dual, which is to say that it is the ability to cognize but not yet consciousness of anything, for there is no split yet into subject and object."" This is different from the Buddha's point of view, in which consciousness is always consciousness of something. Jurewicz then compares the Vedic creator's desire and hunger to create the atman (or ""his second self"") with volitional impulses (samskara). According to Jurewicz, the third nidana, vijñana, can be compared to the atman's vijñanamaya kosha in Vedic literature, which is the consciousness of the creator and his subjective manifestations.

According to Jurewicz, ""in Vedic cosmogony, the act of giving a name and a form marks the final formation of the creator's atman."" This may go back to the Vedic birth ceremony in which a father gives a name to his son. In Vedic creation pure consciousness creates the world as name and form (nama-rupa) and then enters it. However, in this process, consciousness also hides from itself, losing sight of its real identity. The Buddhist view of consciousness entering name and form depicts a similar chain of events leading to deeper ignorance and entanglement with the world.

Jurewizc further argues that the rest of the twelve nidanas show similarities with the terms and ideas found in Vedic cosmogeny, especially as it relates to the sacrificial fire (as a metaphor for desire and existence). These Vedic terms may have been adopted by the Buddha to communicate his message of not-self because his audience (often educated in Vedic thought) would understand their basic meaning. According to Jurewizc, dependent origination replicates the general Vedic creation model, but negates its metaphysics and its morals. Furthermore, Jurewizc argues that:This deprives the Vedic cosmogony of its positive meaning as the successful activity of the Absolute and presents it as a chain of absurd, meaningless changes which could only result in the repeated death of anyone who would reproduce this cosmogonic process in ritual activity and everyday life.According to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of their connection with the Vedic worldview that the Buddha was critiquing in the first four links of dependent origination. Though it was aware that at the fourth link there should be an appearance of an individual person, the Buddhist tradition equated rupa with the first skandha, and nama with the other four skandhas. Yet, as Gombrich notes, samkhara, vijnana, and vedana also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this equation can't be correct for this nidana.

Synthesis of older lists

Early synthesis by the Buddha
According to Erich Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain resulted from the Buddha's combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of dukkha from tanha, ""thirst,"" craving. Later on, the Buddha incorporated avijja, ""ignorance,"" as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part of dependent origination. Frauwallner saw this ""purely mechanical mixing"" as ""enigmatical"", ""contradictory"" and a ""deficiency in systematization.""

Paul Williams discusses Frauwallner's idea that the 12 links may be a composite. However, he ultimately concludes that ""it may be impossible at our present stage of scholarship to work out very satisfactorily what the original logic of the full twelvefold formula was intended to be, if there ever was one intention at all.""

As a later synthesis by monks 
Hajime Nakamura has argued that we should search the Sutta Nipata for the earliest form of dependent origination since it is the most ancient source. According to Nakamura, ""the main framework of later theories of Dependent Origination"" can be reconstructed from the Sutta Nipata as follows: avidya, tanha, upadana, bhava, jaramarana. Lambert Schmitthausen has also argued that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.

According to Mathieu Boisvert, nidana 3-10 correlate with the five skandhas. Boisvert notes that while sañña, ""perception,"" is not found in the twelvefold chain, it does play a role in the processes described by the chain, particularly between feeling and the arising of samskaras. Likewise, Waldron notes that the anusaya, ""underlying tendencies, are the link between the cognitive processes of phassa (""contact"") and vedana (feeling), and the afflictive responses of tanha (""craving"") and upadana (""grasping"").

Hans Wolfgang Schumann argues that a comparison of the twelve nidanas with the five skhandhas shows that the 12 link chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration. Schumann thus concluded that the twelvefold chain was a later synthesis composed by Buddhist monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed nidana 1–4, 5–8, and 8-12. Schumann also proposes that the 12 nidanas are extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme.

According to Richard Gombrich, the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with tanha, ""thirst,"" the cause of suffering as described in the second noble truth"". The first list consists of the first four nidanas, which reference Vedic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz. According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in its reverse version.

Bucknell's thesis

Roderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the pratitya-samutpada sequence. The twevefold version is the ""standard version,"" in which vijnana refers to sensual consciousness. According to Bucknell, the ""standard version"" of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived two different versions that understand consciousness (vijñana) and name and form (namarupa) differently.

According to Bucknell, SN 35.106 describes a non-linear ""branched version"" of dependent origination in which consciousness is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects (and thus represents sense perception). The Mahānidānasutta (DN 15) describes a ""looped version,"" in which consciousness and nama-rupa condition each other. It also describes consciousness descending into the womb. According to Bucknell, ""some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop.

Waldron also mentions idea that in early Buddhism, consciousness may have been understood as having these two different aspects (basic consciousness or sentience and cognitive sense consciousness). While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of alaya-vijñana.

In yet another linear version, dubbed the ""Sutta-nipata version"",  consciousness is derived from avijja (""ignorance"") and saṅkhāra (""activities"" also translated as ""volitional formations"").

According to Bucknell, while the ""branched version"" refers directly to the six sense objects, the ""looped version"" and the standard version instead use the term nama-rupa as ""a collective term for the six types of sense object."" He cites various passages from the early sources and the scholarship of Yinshun, Reat and Watsuji in support. Bucknell thinks that name and form was eventually misinterpreted as referring to ""mind and body"", causing discrepancies in the 12 fold series and making it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth. According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for consciousness and name and form, may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order. Bucknell further notes that the ""branched version,"" corresponds with the interpretation of the twelve nidanas as mental processes while the ""looped version,"" (which sees consciousness as the ""rebirth consciousness"") corresponds with the ""three lives"" interpretation.

The 12 nidānas as an early list 
Against the view that the 12 link chain is later, Alex Wayman writes ""I am convinced that the full twelve members have been in Buddhism since earliest times, just as it is certain that a natural division into the first seven and last five was also known.""

Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that the suggestions of some scholars the twelvefold formula is a later expansion of a shorter list ""remain purely conjectural, misleading, and objectionable on doctrinal and textual grounds.""

Choong, in his comparative study of SN and SA also writes that the different accounts of dependent origination existed at an early stage and that they are simply different ways of presenting the same teaching which would have been used for different times and with audiences. Choong writes that the various versions of dependent arising ""are unlikely to represent a progressive development, with some being earlier and others later"" and that ""the comparative data revealed here do not provide evidence to support the speculative suggestion that there was just one original (or relatively early) account of the series, from which the other attested accounts developed later.""

Comparison of lists
The following chart compares different lists of nidanas from the early sources with other similar lists:

Transcendental/reverse dependent origination 
Understanding dependent origination is indispensable for realizing nirvana since it leads to insight into how the process of dependent arising can be brought to an end (i.e. nirvana). Since the process of dependent origination always produces suffering, the reversal or deactivation of the sequence is seen by Buddhists as the way to stop the entire process. Traditionally, the reversal of the sequence of the twelve nidanas is explained as leading to the cessation of rebirth and suffering. The early Buddhist texts state that on the arising of wisdom or insight into the true nature of things, dependent origination ceases. Some suttas state that ""from the fading and cessation of ignorance without remainder comes the cessation of saṅkhāras..."" et cetera (this is said to lead to the cessation of the entire twelve-fold chain in reverse order).

According to Jayarava Atwood, while some dependent origination passages (termed lokiya, worldly) ""[model] beings trapped in cycles of craving and grasping, birth and death"", other passages (termed lokuttara, ‘beyond the world’) ""[model] the process and dynamics of liberation from those same cycles."" According to Bodhi, these are also classified as ""exposition of the round"" (vaṭṭakathā) and ""the ending of the round"" (vivaṭṭakathā). Beni Barua called these two different kinds of dependent origination ""cyclic"" and ""progressive"". Various early Buddhist texts present different sequences of transcendental dependent origination (lokuttara paṭicca-samuppāda) or reverse dependent origination (paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda). The Upanisā Sutta (and its Chinese parallel at MĀ 55) is the only text in which both types of dependent origination appear side by side and therefore it has become the main source used to teach reverse dependent origination in English language sources. Jayarava cites numerous other Pali suttas which contain various lists of dependently originated phenomena that lead to liberation, each one being a ""precondition"" (upanisā) for the next one in the sequence.

According to Jayarava, AN 11.2 (which has a parallel at MA 43) is a better representative of transcendental dependent origination passages and better conforms ""to the general outline of the Buddhist path as consisting of ethics, meditation and wisdom."" AN 11.2 states that once someone has fulfilled one element of the path, it naturally leads to the next one. Therefore, there is no need to will or wish (Pali: cetanā, intention, volition) for one thing to lead to the other one, since this happens effortlessly. Therefore, the sutta states that ""good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore."" The process begins with the cultivation of ethics, using the following formula which is then applied to each further factor sequentially: ""Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: ‘May I have no regrets!’ It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets...etc.""

Comparison of Lists 
The following chart compares various transcendental dependent arising sequences found in Pali and Chinese sources:

Interpretations
There are numerous interpretations of the doctrine of dependent origination across the different Buddhist traditions and within them as well. Various systematizations of the doctrine were developed by the Abhidharma traditions which arose after the death of the Buddha. Modern scholars have also interpreted the teaching in different ways. According to Ajahn Brahm, a fully correct understanding of dependent origination can only be known by awakened being or ariyas. Brahm notes that ""this goes a long way to answering the question why there is so much difference of opinion on the meaning of dependent origination.""

Collett Cox writes that the majority of scholarly investigations of dependent origination adopt two main interpretations of dependent origination, they either see it as ""a generalized and logical principle of abstract conditioning applicable to all phenomena"" or they see it as a ""descriptive model for the operation of action (karman) and the process of rebirth."" According to Bhikkhu Analayo, there are two main interpretative models of the 12 nidanas in the later Buddhist exegetical literature, a model which sees the 12 links as working across three lives (the past life, the present life, the future life) and a model which analyzes how the 12 links are mental processes working in the present moment. Analayo argues that these are not mutually exclusive, but instead are complementary interpretations.

Alex Wayman has argued that understanding the dependent origination formula requires understanding its two main interpretations. According to Wayman, these two are: (1) the general principle of dependent origination itself, its nidanas and their relationships and (2) how it deals with the particular process of the rebirth of sentient beings.

Conditionality 
The general principle of conditionality is expressed in numerous early sources as ""When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases."" According to Rupert Gethin, this basic principle is neither a direct Newtonian-like causality nor a singular form of causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect and plural conditionality which is somewhat different from classic European views on causation. The Buddhist concept of dependence is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in a certain realm of existence for another lifetime.

Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that the Buddhist principle of conditionality ""shows that the ""texture"" of being is through and through relational."" Furthermore, he notes that dependent arising goes further than just presenting a general theory about conditionality, it also teaches a specific conditionality (idappaccayatā), which explains change in terms of specific conditions. Dependent arising therefore also explains the structure of relationships between specific types of phenomena (in various interlocking sequences) which lead to suffering as well as the ending of suffering.

Necessary and sufficient conditions 
Ajahn Brahm has argued that the Buddhist doctrine of conditionality includes two main elements of the logical concepts of conditionality: necessity and sufficiency. According to Brahm, “when this is, that is; from the arising of this, that arises.” refers to a ""sufficient condition"" while “when this is not, that is not; from the ceasing of this, that ceases” refers to a ""necessary condition"". Like Brahm, Bodhi also argues that there are two main characterizations of conditionality in the early sources. One is positive, indicating ""a contributory influence passing from the condition to the dependent state,"" while the other is negative, indicating ""the impossibility of the dependent state appearing in the absence of its condition."" He compares these two with the first and second phrases of the general principle definition respectively. Regarding the second, positive characterization, other early sources also state that a condition ""originates (samudaya) the dependent state, provides it with a source (nidāna), generates it (jātika), gives it being (pabhava), nourishes it (āhāra), acts as its foundation (upanisā), causes it to surge (upayāpeti)"" (see: SN 12.11, 23, 27, 66, 69).

However, according to Harvey and Brahm, while the 12 nidanas are necessary conditions for each other, not all of them are necessary and sufficient conditions (some are, some are not). As Harvey notes, if this was the case, ""when a buddha or arahat experienced feeling they would inevitably experience craving"" (but they do not). As such, feeling is only one of the conditions for craving (another one is ignorance). Therefore, in this Buddhist view of causality, nothing has a single cause. Bodhi agrees with this, stating that not all conditional relations in dependent arising are based on direct causal necessitation. While in some cases there is a direct necessary relationship between the phenomena outlined in the lists (birth will always lead to death), in other cases there is not. This is an important point because as Bodhi notes, ""if dependent arising described a series in which each factor necessitated the  next, the series could never be broken,"" and liberation would be impossible.

Abhidharma views of conditionality 
The Buddhist abhidharma traditions developed a more complex schematization of conditionality than that found in the early sources. These systems outlined different kinds of conditional relationships. According to K.L. Dhammajoti, vaibhāṣika abhidharma developed two major schemes to explain conditional relations: the four conditions (pratyaya) and the six causes (hetu). The vaibhāṣika system also defended a theory of simultaneous causation. While simultaneous causation was rejected by the sautrāntika school, it was later adopted by yogācāra. The Theravāda abhidhamma also developed a complex analysis of conditional relations, which can be found in the Paṭṭhāna. A key element of this system is that nothing arises from a single cause or as a solitary phenomenon, instead there are always a plurality of conditions giving rise to clusters of dhammas (phenomena). The Theravāda abhidhamma outlines twenty four kinds of conditional relations.

Conditioned or unconditioned? 
As a result of their doctrinal development, the various sectarian Buddhist schools eventually became divided over the question of whether or not the very principle of dependent origination was itself conditioned (saṃskṛta) or unconditioned (asaṃskṛta). This debate also included other terms such as “stability of dharma” (dharmasthititā) and “suchness” (tathatā), which were not always seen as synonymous with ""dependent origination"" by all schools. The Theravāda, vātsīputriya and sarvāstivāda school generally affirmed that dependent origination itself was conditioned. The mahāsāṃghikas and mahīśāsakas accepted the conditioned nature of the “stability of dharma,” but both held that dependent origination itself was unconditioned. The Dharmaguptaka's Śāriputrābhidharma also held that dependent origination was unconditioned.

Ontological principle

Relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, Peter Harvey and Paul Williams, dependent arising can be understood as an ontological principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except nirvana. This ontology holds that all physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease. These 'dependent arisings' are causally conditioned, and thus pratityasamutpada is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology. As Williams explains, ""all elements of samsara exist in some sense or another relative to their causes and conditions. That is why they are impermanent, for if the cause is impermanent then so too will be the effect.""

Gombrich describes dependent origination as the idea that ""nothing accessible to our reason or our normal experience exists without a cause"". Furthermore, this can be seen as a metaphysical middle way which does not see phenomena as existing essentially nor as not-existing at all. Instead it sees the world as ""a world of flux and process"", a world of ""verbs, not nouns.""

According to Rupert Gethin, the ontological principle of dependent origination is applied not only to explain the nature and existence of matter and empirically observed phenomenon, but also to the causally conditioned nature and existence of life. Indeed, according to Williams, the goal of this analysis is to understand how suffering arises for sentient beings through an impersonal law and thus how it can also be brought to an end by reversing its causes. Understood in this way, dependent origination has no place for a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'. In this worldview, there is no ‘first cause’ from which all beings arose, instead, every thing arises in dependence on something else.

Though Eviatar Shulman sees dependent origination as mainly being concerned with mental processes, he also states that it ""possessed important ontological implications"" which ""suggest that rather than things being conditioned by other things, they are actually conditioned by consciousness."" This is implied by the fact that form (rūpa) is said to be conditioned by consciousness and willed activities (saṇkhara) as well as by how grasping is said to condition existence (bhava). For Shulman, ""these forms of conditioning undermine the realistic ontology normally attributed to early Buddhism"" and furthermore ""suggest that the mind has power over objects beyond what we normally believe"" as well as implying that ""ontology is secondary to experience.""

While some scholars have argued that the Buddha put aside all metaphysical questions, Noa Ronkin argues that, while he rejected certain metaphysical questions, he was not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless. Instead, the Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.

Rebirth

Analysis of rebirth without a self 
The view that the application of dependent origination in the twelve nidanas is closely connected with rebirth is supported by passages from the early sources. Both the Sammādiṭṭhisutta and the Mahānidānasutta specifically mention the factors of dependent origination as being related to the process of conception in the womb. Bhikkhu Bodhi affirms the centrality of rebirth for dependent origination. Bodhi writes that ""the primary purpose, as seen in the most archaic Buddhist texts, is to show the causal origination of suffering, which is sustained precisely by our bondage to rebirth.""

Ajahn Brahm agrees, writing that the main purpose of dependent origination is to explain ""how there can be rebirth without a soul"" and ""why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end."" Brahm cites the definitions of the nidanas in the Vibhaṅgasutta (SN 12.2) which clearly indicate that birth and death is meant literally. According to Brahm,Paṭicca-samuppāda shows the empty process, empty of a soul that is, which flows within a life and overflows into another life. It also shows the forces at work in the process, which drive it this way and that, even exercising sway in a subsequent life. Dependent origination also reveals the answer to how kamma done in a previous life can affect a person in this life.  Brahm argues that there are two parallel processes at work in dependent origination (which are really one process looked at from different angles), one is delusion and kamma leading to rebirth consciousness (nidanas # 1 - 3) and the other is craving and clinging leading to existence and rebirth (# 8 - 11). Brahm describes this as follows: ""deluded kamma and craving produce the fuel which generates existence and rebirth (into that existence), thereby giving rise to the start of the stream of consciousness that is at the heart of the new life.""

Furthermore, dependent origination explains rebirth without appeal to an unchanging self or soul (atman). Paul Williams sees dependent origination as closely connected with the doctrine of not-self (anatman) which rejects the idea there is a unchanging essence that moves across lives. Williams cites the Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta as showing how dependent origination is to be seen as an alternative theory to such views. According to Williams, dependent origination allows the Buddha to replace a view of the world based on unchanging selves ""with an appeal to what he sees as being its essentially dynamic nature, a dynamism of experiences based on the centrality of causal conditioning.""

Bhikkhu Analayo writes that ""dependent arising is the other side of the coin of emptiness, in the sense of the absence of a substantial and unchanging entity anywhere in subjective experience. Experience or existence is nothing but conditions. This leaves no room for positing a self of any type.""

According to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of ""a sequence of stages prior to birth,"" as an ""orthodox defense against any doctrine of a 'supernal self' or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (jīva) that followers could presume to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula."" According to Mazard, ""many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly.""

Abhidharma three life model 

In the Buddhist Abhidharma traditions like the Theravāda, more systematized explanations of the twelve nidanas developed. As an expository device, the commentarial traditions of the Theravāda, sarvāstivāda-vaibhasika and sautrantika schools defended an interpretation which saw the 12 factors as a sequence that spanned three lives. This is sometimes referred to as the ""prolonged"" explanation of dependent origination.

The three life interpretation can first be seen in the Paṭisambhidāmagga (I.275, circa 2nd or 3rd c. BCE). It is also defended by the Theravāda scholar Buddhaghosa (c. fifth century CE) in his influential Visuddhimagga (Vism.578–8I) and it became standard in Theravada. The three-lives model, with its ""embryological"" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the Sarvāstivāda school as evidenced by the Abhidharmakosa (AKB.III.21–4) of Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) and the Jñanaprasthana. Wayman notes that this model is also present in Asanga's Abhidharmasamuccaya and is commented on by Nagarjuna.

The three lives interpretation can be broken down as follows:

 The previous life: the first two nidanas, namely ignorance and mental fabrications. They are basis for the events in the present. Nyanatiloka, writing from a traditional Theravada perspective, calls these ""karma process"" (kamma-bhava).
 The present life: The third to the tenth nidanas (consciousness, nama-rupa, the sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming) relate to the present life. This begins with the descent of vijnana (consciousness, perception) into the womb. Nyanatiloka notes that nidanas 3-7 are part of the ""rebirth process"" (uppatti-bhava) and nidanas are 8-10 are ""karma process"".
 The future life: The last two nidanas (birth, old age and death) represent the future lives conditioned by the present causes. Nyanatiloka states these last two nidanas are a ""rebirth process.""

Bhikkhu Bodhi notes that this distribution of the 12 nidanas into three lives ""is an expository device employed for the purpose of exhibiting the inner dynamics of the round. It should not be read as implying hard and fast divisions, for in lived experience the factors are always intertwined."" Furthermore, Bodhi argues that these twelve causes are not something hidden, but are ""the fundamental pattern of experience"" which ""always present, always potentially accessible to our awareness.""

Nagarjuna's Pratityasamutpada-hrdaya-karika also outlines the 12 nidanas as a rebirth process. According to Wayman, Nagarjuna's explanation is as follows: ""the three defilements - nescience, craving, and indulgence - give rise to the two karmas - motivations and gestation - and that these two give rise to the seven sufferings - perception, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, feelings, re-birth, and old age and death."" Vasubandhu's presentation is fully consistent with Nagarjuna's: ""nescience, craving, and indulgence are defilement; motivations and gestations are karma; the remaining seven are the basis (asraya) as well as the fruit (phala).

As outlined by Wayman, Asanga's Abhidharma-samuccaya divides the nidanas into the following groups:
 Nidanas 1, 2 and 3 which cast beings downward into the whirl of transmigration
 Nidanas 4 to 7 represent what undergoes transmigration, ""the aspects of the person undergoing phenomenal life"" (Wayman).
 Nidanas 8, 9, 10 produce new karma
 Nidanas 11 and 12 are the fruits or results of karma produced previously

According to Gombrich, the ""contorted"" three lives interpretation is rendered unnecessary by the analysis provided by Jurewicz and other scholars which show that the 12 link chain is a composite list.

Mental processes 
The twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within various Buddhist traditions as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment or across a series of moments.

Abhidharma interpretations 
Prayudh Payutto notes that in Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the Vibhaṅga, the principle of dependent origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment. Furthermore, according to Payutto, there is material in the Vibhaṅga which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model (at Vibh.147) and the one mind moment model. Similarly, Cox notes that the Sarvastivadin Vijñānakāya contains two interpretations of dependent origination, one which explains the 12 nidanas as functioning in a single moment as a way to account for ordinary experience and another interpretation that understands the 12 nidanas as arising sequentially, emphasizing their role in the functioning of rebirth and karma.

Wayman notes that an interpretation referring to mental processes (referred to as dependent origination with a transient character) can also be found in northern sources, such as the Jñānaprasthāna, the Arthaviniscaya-tika and the Abhidharmakosa (AKB.III.24d). The Jñānaprasthāna, explains the nidanas with the example of the act of killing. Ignorance leads to the motivation to kill, which is acted on through consciousness, name and form and so on. This leads to mental karma being generated (bhava) which leads to the movement of the hand to kill (birth).

The different interpretations of dependent origination as understood in the northern tradition can be found in the Abhidharmakosa, which outlines three models of the twelve nidanas:
Instantaneous – All 12 links ""are realized in one and the same moment"".
Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas is seen as arising at different times (across three lifetimes).
Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in a continuous series of mind moments.

Modern interpretations 
The interpretation of dependent origination as mainly referring to mental processes has been defended by various modern scholars such as Eviatar Shulman and Collett Cox.

Eviatar Shulman argues that dependent origination only addresses ""the way the mind functions in samsara, the processes of mental conditioning that transmigration consists of."" He further argues that it ""should be understood to be no more than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self)."" Shulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination. However, he argues that at its core dependent origination is concerned with ""identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations"". For Shulman, dependent origination does not ""deal with how things exist, but with the processes by which the mind operates.""

Shulman argues that the general principle of dependent origination deals exclusively with the processes outlined in the lists of nidanas (not with existence per se, and certainly not with all objects). Shulman writes that seeing dependent origination as referring to the nature of reality in general ""means investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from later Buddhist discourse"" which leads to a misrepresentation of early Buddhism.

Sue Hamilton presents a similar interpretation which sees dependent origination as showing how all things and indeed our entire ""world"" (of experience) are dependently originated through our cognitive apparatus. As such, Hamilton argues that the focus of this teaching is on our subjective experience, not on anything external to it. Collett Cox also sees the theory of dependent origination found in the early Buddhist sources as an analysis of how suffering is produced in our experience. Cox states that it is only in later Abhidharma literature that dependent origination became an abstract theory of causation.

A similar interpretation has been put forth by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa who argues that, in the list of the twelve nidanas, jati and jaramarana refer not to rebirth and physical death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the ""emergence of the ego"". According to Buddhadhasa,

Ñāṇavīra Thera is another modern Theravada Bhikkhu known for rejecting the traditional interpretation and instead explaining the 12 links as a structural schema which does not happen in successive moments in time, but is instead a timeless structure of experience.

Mahāyāna interpretations 
Mahāyāna Buddhism, which sees dependent arising as closely connected with the doctrine of emptiness, strongly expresses that all phenomena and experiences are empty of independent identity. This is especially important for the madhyamaka school, one of the most influential traditions of Mahayana thought. The yogacara school meanwhile, understands dependent origination through its idealistic philosophy and sees dependent origination as the process that produces the illusory subject-object duality.

One of the most important and widely cited sutras on dependent origination in the Indian Mahayana tradition was the Śālistamba Sūtra (Rice Seedling Sutra). This sutra introduced the well-known Mahayana simile of a rice seed and its sprout as a way to explain conditionality. It also contains the influential passage: ""He who sees dependent arising sees the dharma. He who sees the dharma sees the Buddha."" This sutra contains numerous passages which parallel the early Buddhist sources (such as MN 38) and outlines the classic 12 nidanas. It also contains some unique elements such as the figure of Maitreya, the idea of illusion (māyā) and the idea of the dharmaśarīra (dharma-body). Numerous commentaries were written on this sutra, some of which are attributed to Nāgārjuna (but this is questionable).

Non-arising 
Some Mahāyāna sūtras contain statements which speak of the ""unarisen"" or ""unproduced"" (anutpāda) nature of dharmas. According to Edward Conze, in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, the ontological status of dharmas can be described as having never been produced (anutpāda), as never been brought forth (anabhinirvritti), as well as unborn (ajata). This is illustrated through various similies such as a dream, an illusion and a mirage. Conze also states that the ""patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas"" (anutpattika-dharmakshanti) is ""one of the most distinctive virtues of the Mahāyānistic saint.""

Perhaps the earliest of these sutras, the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā, contains a passage which describes the suchness (tathatā) of dharmas using various terms including shūnyatā, cessation (nirodha) and unarisen (anutpāda). Most famously, the Heart Sutra states:Sariputra, in that way, all phenomena are empty, that is, without characteristic, unproduced, unceased, stainless, not stainless, undiminished, unfilled.The Heart Sutra also negates the 12 links of dependent origination: ""There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, up to and including no aging and death and no extinction of aging and death.""

Some Mahāyāna sūtras present the insight into the non-arisen nature of dharmas as a great achievement of bodhisattvas. The Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra mentions that Vaidehi had, on listening to the teaching in this sutra, attained ""great awakening with clarity of mind and reached the insight into the non-arising of all dharmas."" Similarly, the Vimalakirti sutra mentions various bodhisattvas (including Vimalakirti) that have attained ""the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas."" The Lotus Sutra states that when the ""thought of the highest path"" arises in sentient beings ""they will become convinced of the nonarising of all dharmas and reside in the stage of non-retrogression.""

The Samdhinirmochana Sutras chapter 7 mentions a teaching which states: ""All phenomena are without an essence, unborn, unceasing, primordially in the state of peace, and naturally in the state of nirvāṇa."" However, it states that this teaching is that of the ""discourses of provisional meaning,"" and that it should be taught along with the teachings of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma. Similarly, the Lankavatara sutra explains the doctrine of the unborn and unoriginated nature of dharmas through the idealistic philosophy of mind-only. Since all things are illusory manifestations of the mind, they do not really originate or arise.

 Madhyamaka 

In madhyamaka philosophy, to say that an object dependently originated is synonymous with saying that it is ""empty"" (shunya). This is directly stated by Nāgārjuna in his Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (MMK): Whatever arises dependently, is explained as empty. Thus dependent attribution, is the middle way. Since there is nothing whatever, that is not dependently existent. For that reason, there is nothing whatsoever that is not empty. -- MMK, Ch. 24.18-19 According to Nāgārjuna, all phenomena (dharmas) are empty of svabhāva (variously translated as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, and own being) which refers to a self-sustaining, causally independent and permanent identity.Garfield, Jay L. Dependent Arising and the Emptiness of Emptiness: Why Did Nāgārjuna Start with Causation? Philosophy East and West, Vol. 44, No. 2 (Apr., 1994), pp. 219-250. University of Hawai'i Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399593 Nāgārjuna's philosophical works analyze all phenomena in order to show that nothing at all can exist independently, and yet, they are also not non-existent since they exist conventionally, i.e. as empty dependent arisings. In the very first (dedicatory) verse of the MMK, dependent origination is also described apophatically through ""the eight negations"" as follows ""there is neither cessation nor origination, neither annihilation nor the eternal, neither singularity nor plurality, neither the coming nor the going of any dharma, for the purpose of nirvāṇa characterized by the auspicious cessation of hypostatization [prapañca].""

The first chapter of the MMK focuses on the general idea of causation and attempts to show how it is a process that is empty of any essence. According to Jay Garfield, in the first chapter, Nāgārjuna argues against a reified view of causality which sees dependent origination in terms of substantial powers (kriyā) of causation (hetu) that phenomena have as part of their intrinsic nature (svabhāva). Instead, Nāgārjuna sees dependent origination as a series of conditional relationships (pratyaya) that are merely nominal designations and ""explanatorily useful regularities."" According to Nāgārjuna, if something could exist inherently or essentially from its own side (and thus have its own inherent causal powers), change and dependent arising would be impossible. Nāgārjuna states that ""if things did not exist without essence, the phrase, ""when this exists so this will be,"" would not be acceptable.""

Jan Westerhoff notes that Nāgārjuna argues that cause and effect are ""neither identical nor different nor related as part and whole, they are neither successive, nor simultaneous, nor overlapping."" Westerhoff states that Nāgārjuna thinks all conceptual frameworks of causality that make use of such ideas are based on a mistaken presupposition which is that ""cause and effect exist with their own svabhāva"". Westerhoff further argues that for Nāgārjuna, causes and effects are both dependent on one another (conceptually and existentially) and neither one can exist independently. As such, he rejects four ways that something could be causally produced: by itself, by something else, by both, by nothing at all. Westerhoff also notes that for Nāgārjuna, cause and effect do not exist objectively, that is to say, they are not independent of a cognizing subject. As such, cause and effect are ""not just mutually interdependent, but also mind-dependent."" This means that for Nāgārjuna, causality and causally constructed objects are ultimately just conceptual constructs.

Nāgārjuna applies a similar analysis to numerous other kinds of phenomena in the MMK such as motion, the self, and time. Chapter 7 of the MMK attempts to argue against the idea that dependent arising exists either as a conditioned entity or as an unconditioned one. Rejecting both options, Nāgārjuna ends this chapter by stating that dependent arising is like an illusion, a dream or a city of gandharvas (a stock example for a mirage). Chapter 20 tackles the question of whether an assemblage of causes and conditions can produce an effect (it is argued that it cannot). This analysis of dependent arising therefore means that emptiness itself is empty. As Jay Garfield explains, this means that emptiness (and thus dependent origination) ""is not a self-existent void standing behind the veil of illusion represented by conventional reality, but merely an aspect of conventional reality.""

 Yogācāra 
The yogācāra school interpreted the doctrine of dependent origination through its central schema of the ""three natures"" (which are really three ways of looking at one dependently originated reality). In this schema, the constructed or fabricated nature is an illusory appearance (of a dualistic self), while the ""dependent nature"" refers specifically to the process of dependent origination or as Jonathan Gold puts it ""the causal story that brings about this seeming self."" Furthermore, as Gold notes, in Yogacara, ""this causal story is entirely mental,"" and so our body, sense bases and so on are illusory appearances. Indeed, D.W. Mitchell writes that yogācāra sees consciousness as ""the causal force"" behind dependent arising.

Dependent origination is therefore ""the causal series according to which the mental seeds planted by previous deeds ripen into the appearance of the sense bases"". This ""stream of dependent mental processes"" as Harvey describes it, is what generates the subject-object split (and thus the idea of a '""self"" and ""other"" things which are not the self). The third nature then, is the fact that dependent origination is empty of a self, the fact that even though self (as well as an ""other"", that which is apart from the self) appears, it does not exist.

 The 12 nidanas in Mahāyāna sutras and tantras 
Alex Wayman writes that Mahāyāna texts such as Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra present an alternative interpretation of the twelve nidanas. According to Wayman, this interpretation holds that arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas have eliminated the four kinds of clinging (nidana # 9), which are the usual condition for existence (or ""gestation"", nidana #10) and rebirth (#11) in one of the three realms. Instead of being reborn, they have a ""body made of mind"" (manōmaya kāya), which is a special consciousness (vijñana). This consciousness is projected by ignorance (nidana #1) and purified by a special kind of samskara (# 2) called ""nonfluxional karma"" (anāsrava-karma). These mind-made bodies produce a reflected image in the three worlds, and thus they appear to be born.

According to Wayman, this view of dependent origination posits ""a dualistic structure of the world, in the manner of heaven and earth, where the ""body made of mind"" is in heaven and its reflected image, or coarser equivalent, is on earth. Otherwise stated, the early members of Dependent Origination apply to the superior realm, the later members to the inferior realm. But the Śrī-mālā-Sūtra does not clarify how those members are allotted to their respective realms.""

According to Wayman, similar interpretations appear in tantric texts, such as the Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatantra. This tantra contains a passage which appears to suggest that ""the first ten terms of dependent origination are prenatal."" He also notes that there is a tantric interpretation of dependent origination in the Guhyasamājatantra, ""in which the first three members are equivalent to three mystical light stages.

 Tibetan interpretations 

Tibetan Buddhist scholars rely on the north Indian works of scholars such as Asanga, Vasubandhu and Nagarjuna in their interpretation of the 12 nidanas. For example, according to Wayman, Tsongkhapa, attempted to harmonize the presentations of the 12 links found in Nagarjuna and in Asanga. Tsongkhapa also explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person.

Discussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a bardo or an intermediate state (which is denied in Theravada) between death and rebirth. The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.

Madhyamaka is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. Some scholars accept a version of the shentong view introduced by Dolpopa (1292–1361), which argues that buddha-nature and buddhahood was not dependently originated and thus not empty of itself (but empty of what is not itself). The Gelug school which follows Tsongkhapa's thought rejects this view, and instead holds that all phenomena are said to lack inherent existence (svabhava) and thus, everything is empty and dependently originated. Other Tibetan madhyamakas like Gorampa argue for a more anti-realist view, negating the very existence of all phenomena and seeing them all as illusions. Meanwhile, scholars of the Nyingma school such as Ju Mipham have also attempted to interpret orthodox madhyamaka in a way that is compatible with the view of dzogchen.

Interdependence
The Huayan school taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (yuánróng, 圓融), as expressed in the metaphor of Indra's net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra and the writings of the patriarchs of Huayan.

Thích Nhất Hạnh explains this concept as follows: ""You cannot just be by yourself alone. You have to inter-be with every other thing."" He uses the example of a sheet of paper that can only exist due to every other cause and condition (sunshine, rain, trees, people, the mind etc). According to Hanh ""this sheet of paper is, because everything else is.""

Sogyal Rinpoche states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence.

According to Richard Gombrich, the East Asian interpretation of dependent origination as the idea that ""all phenomena exert causal influence on each other"" does not follow from the early Buddhist understanding of dependent origination. He further argues that this interpretation ""would subvert the Buddha’s teaching of karma."" This is because ""if we were heirs of other people’s deeds, the whole moral edifice would collapse.""

Comparison with western philosophy
The concept of pratītyasamutpāda has also been compared to Western metaphysics, the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.

The Hellenistic philosophy of Pyrrhonism parallels the Buddhist view of dependent origination, as it does in many other matters (see: similarities between Phyrrhonism and Buddhism). Aulus Gellius in Attic Nights describes how appearances are produced by relative interactions between mind and body and how there are no self-dependent things. The ancient Commentary on Plato's Theaetetus also defends a kind of relativism which states that nothing has its own intrinsic character.

Jay L. Garfield states that Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamikakarika uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.

16,"was an old province of Japan which today consists of the eastern part of Shimane Prefecture. It was sometimes called . The province is in the Chūgoku Region.

History 
During the early Kofun period (3rd century) this region was independent and constructed rectangular tumuli. But in the fourth century this region saw the construction of rectangular and key shaped tumuli.

During the 6th or 7th century it was absorbed due to the expansion of the state of Yamato, within which it assumed the role of a sacerdotal domain.

Even today, the Izumo Shrine constitutes (as does the Grand Shrine of Ise) one of the most important sacred places of Shinto: it is dedicated to kami, especially to Ōkuninushi (Ō-kuni-nushi-no-mikoto), mythical progeny of Susanoo and all the clans of Izumo. The mythological mother of Japan, the goddess Izanami, is said to be buried on Mt. Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and Hōki, near modern-day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture.

By the Sengoku period, Izumo had lost much of its importance. It was dominated before the Battle of Sekigahara by the Mōri clan, and after Sekigahara, it was an independent fief with a castle town at modern Matsue.

In Japanese mythology, the entrance to Yomi (Hell, land of the dead) was located within the province, and was sealed by the god Izanagi by placing a large boulder over the entrance.

17,"Blandford Forum ( ), commonly Blandford, is a market town in Dorset, England, sited by the River Stour about  northwest of Poole. It was the administrative headquarters of North Dorset District until April 2019, when this was abolished and its area incorporated into the new Dorset unitary authority.

Blandford is notable for its Georgian architecture, the result of rebuilding after the majority of the town was destroyed by a fire in 1731. The rebuilding work was assisted by an Act of Parliament and a donation by George II, and the rebuilt town centre—to designs by local architects John and William Bastard—has survived to the present day largely intact.

Blandford Camp, a military base, is sited on the hills  northeast of the town. It is the base of the Royal Corps of Signals, the communications wing of the British Army, and the site of the Royal Signals Museum.

Dorset County Council estimates that in 2013 the town's civil parish had a population of 10,610. The town's economy is based on a mix of the service sector and light industry, and provides employment for about 4,000 people.

History
Blandford has been a fording point on the River Stour since Anglo-Saxon times. The name Blandford derives from the Old English blǣge, and probably means ford where gudgeon or blay are found. The name Blaneford or Bleneford is recorded in the Domesday Book, referring not to Blandford Forum itself but to the adjacent villages of Bryanston and Blandford St Mary on the opposite side of the ford, and Langton Long Blandford further downstream.

By the 13th century, the settlement on the north bank of the river had become a market town with a livestock market serving the nearby Blackmore Vale with its many dairy farms. At the start of the 14th century it returned two members of parliament and was also known as Cheping Blandford, where Cheping or Chipping refers to a market. The Latin translation Forum was first recorded in 1540.

In Survey of Dorsetshire, written by Thomas Gerard of Trent in the early 1630s, Blandford was described as ""a faire Markett Towne, pleasantlie seated upon the River ... well inhabitted and of good Traffique"". In the 17th-century English Civil War Blandford was a Royalist centre; most inhabitants supported the king.

In the 18th century Blandford was one of several lace-making centres in the county; Daniel Defoe stated that lace made in the town was ""the finest bonelace in England... I think I never saw better in Flanders, France or Italy"". In the 17th and 18th centuries Blandford was also a malting and brewing centre of some significance.

Almost all of Blandford's buildings were destroyed on 4 June 1731 by the ""great fire"", which was the last of several serious fires that occurred in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The fire began in a tallow chandler's workshop on a site that is now The King's Arms public house. Within a few hours, almost 90% of the town's fabric had gone; all fire-fighting equipment had been lost to the fire and the church's lead roof had melted. Even properties west of the river in Blandford St Mary and Bryanston were burned, though notable buildings that survived in the town include the Ryves Almshouses and Dale House in Salisbury Street, Old House in The Close, and much of East Street. An Act of Parliament was introduced that stated that rebuilding work must be in brick and tile and should begin within four years. With assistance from the rest of the country—including £1,000 given by King George II—the town was rebuilt over the next ten years to the designs of local architects John and William Bastard. Bottlenecks were removed and streets realigned in the new town plan, which also provided a wider market place. As well as residential and commercial property, new buildings included a new town hall, school and church. The redesigned town centre has survived to the present day virtually intact.

After the post-fire reconstruction Blandford remained a thriving market town. Wool spinning and button making were also significant, and the brewing and hostelry trades expanded. The turnpike road between Salisbury and Dorchester was made in 1756 and passed through the town, and the arrival of the coaching era increased the town's prosperity, though the built fabric of the town changed little until the first half of the 19th century, when houses for wealthier inhabitants were built to the north alongside the roads to Salisbury and Shaftesbury. Later in the 19th century, perhaps following the installation of piped water, more densely packed buildings were built to the northeast, replacing gardens and barracks for the poor (that had been erected following the fire) between the roads to Salisbury and Wimborne Minster. Rail transport arrived in Blandford in the 1860s, though this did not impact greatly on the town's economy.

Blandford's weekly animal market disappeared in the 20th century, perhaps a casualty of motorised transport that enabled larger markets to be held in fewer centres (the market at nearby Sturminster Newton increased significantly). By the middle of the 20th century Blandford Fair, a seasonal sheep fair held in summer and autumn, had also disappeared, due to changes in animal husbandry and a reduction in sheep numbers in the county.

Governance
In the United Kingdom national parliament, Blandford is in the North Dorset parliamentary constituency whose current Member of Parliament (MP) is Simon Hoare of the Conservative party. At the top tier of local government Blandford is governed by Dorset Council, which provides all services apart from those provided by Blandford Forum Town Council, which has responsibilities that include outdoor fitness and play areas, CCTV, the cemetery and allotments, venue hire, the indoor market, grass cutting and grit bins.

For electoral purposes Blandford is divided into four electoral wards: Blandford Central, Blandford Hilltop, Blandford Langton St.Leonards and Blandford Old Town. A fifth ward, Riversdale and Portman, covers Bryanston and Blandford St Mary west of the river; these are not within the parish of Blandford, but the town's built-up area extends into Blandford St Mary parish. In national parliamentary elections these five wards are joined with 22 others that together elect the Member of Parliament for the North Dorset constituency. In town council elections Blandford's four wards together elect thirteen councillors to Blandford Forum Town Council; Blandford Central ward elects seven councillors, and the other three wards each elect three. The mayor of Blandford for 2021–22 is LEE HITCHINGS.

Geography
Blandford is situated between Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, to the south-east of the Blackmore Vale,  northwest of Poole and  southwest of Salisbury. It is sited in the valley of the River Stour, mostly on rising ground northeast of the river, but with some development south of the river at Blandford St Mary. The underlying geology is Cretaceous chalk bedrock that in places is overlain by Quaternary drift: alluvium in the river's flood plain, head deposits around the town's southwest, south and southeast borders, and clay with flints at the highest part of the town in the north. The town is almost surrounded by land that has been designated as having landscape value of national significance: the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) to the west and the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs AONB to the north and east.

Architecture
Most of the buildings in Blandford's centre are Georgian, due to the rebuilding after the 1731 fire and the absence of subsequent change. Pevsner stated that ""hardly any other town in England can be compared with it"". A 1970 report by Donald Insall Associates described Blandford as ""the most complete and cohesive surviving example of a Georgian country town in England"", with the Market Place area in particular given the status of ""An Area of National Importance"" and described as ""a brilliant master piece"" [sic]. Buildings that have received Grade I listing by English Heritage are the parish church of St Peter and St Paul, the town hall and corn exchange, The Old House, Coupar House, Pump House, and several buildings in Market Place: numbers 18, 20 and 26, and the old Greyhound Inn. All the listed structures in Market Place, including the church and another seventeen buildings with either Grade II or Grade II* status, form a group, together with several listed properties in West Street and East Street.

The parish church of St Peter and St Paul was built between 1732 and 1739 and is a classical building with a cupola on top of the tower. The design by John Bastard originally specified that the tower would have a steeple, but lack of money resulted in the wooden cupola instead, a decision that disgusted Bastard, who stated that ""it will not keep the wett nor the weather out"". Sir Frederick Treves was not a fan of the church's appearance, describing it in his 1906 Highways & Byways in Dorset as ""ugly, and only tolerable from a distance"". The interior remains relatively unaffected by Victorian interference and retains its font, pulpit, box pews and Mayoral seat. The pulpit, originally designed for St Antholin's in London, is by Sir Christopher Wren. The organ, dating from 1794, is by George Pike England and is the most intact of his surviving works; it allegedly had been intended for the Savoy Chapel in London, but was too big, so George III supposedly gave it to Blandford instead. In 1893 the church was enlarged by moving the apsidal sanctuary out on rollers onto new foundations and building a new chancel behind it. The Victorians did install galleries to accommodate an increasing congregation, though these were removed in the 1970s, a change that Pevsner called ""a visual blessing"".

Blandford Forum Town Hall occupies a site in the Market Place close to the site that was occupied by its predecessor. It dates from 1734 and has a two-storey three-windowed frontage of Portland stone ashlar. The ground floor has three semi-circular arches leading to an open portico or loggia, called The Shambles, that used to be part of the market. Toward the back of the building is the old corn exchange, a late 19th-century assembly hall with ""interesting elliptical roof-trusses"".

Coupar House, dated around 1750, is the largest private house in Blandford that dates from the post-fire period. It has a richly decorated interior with a notable staircase, and is unique among the town's private dwellings for having Portland stone dressings to its brick façade, though the design of this frontage has been described as ""curiously amateurish"" with ""little attention ... paid to rules of proportion"".

The Old House was probably built some time between 1650 and 1670 by a German doctor who practised in Blandford after graduating from The Queen's College, Oxford. Its unusual design, which includes a steep hipped roof with wide spreading eaves, has elements of artisan style popular at the time, though it was described by John Hutchins as ""an architectural graft from the 'fatherland' planted by the worthy doctor on the soil of his adopted country"".

Pump House fire monument was built by John Bastard in classical style to commemorate the fire. It dates from 1760, is of Portland stone and stands adjacent to the churchyard wall. The inscription on its rear wall states its purpose is ""... to prevent by a timely Supply of Water, (with God's Blessing) the fatal Consequences of FIRE hereafter"". In 1768 Bastard provided an endowment of £600. The monument was repaired in 1858 and the pump was replaced by a fountain in 1897.

To the south of the town a six-arch stone bridge spans the River Stour; it is built mostly of greensand with some heathstone and was extensively restored in 1726. The water meadows between it and the town are crossed by a causeway and two smaller bridges.

Demography
In the 2011 census Blandford Forum civil parish and the small neighbouring parish of Langton Long Blandford had a combined population of 10,325. Dorset County Council estimate that in 2013 Blandford Forum parish on its own had a population of 10,610 and Langton Long Blandford had a population of 120. The built-up area of Blandford extends south of the River Stour into the civil parish of Blandford St Mary; in 2013 the population of Blandford St Mary and Blandford Forum civil parishes combined was estimated as 12,110.

Previous census returns for the town show that it had a population of less than 4,000 until 1981, after which it increased rapidly; in the 2001 census, the town had 4,524 dwellings and a population of 8,760, of whom 96.5% were White British. Some of the population increase however can be accounted for by a boundary change which incorporated housing estates that already existed but were previously within a different parish (Pimperne) on the town's northern side. Previous census figures for the town's civil parish are shown in the table below:

Transport

Blandford lies at the junction of the A350 and A354 main roads but is skirted by an eastern bypass. The main road running through the town is the B3082, connecting Blandford Forum to Wimborne Minster. Blandford Forum is around  southwest of junction 1 of the M27 motorway at Cadnam. Buses run from the town to locations including Poole, Bournemouth, Salisbury and Shaftesbury with the primary operator being Wilts & Dorset.

Blandford is  from Bournemouth Airport and  from Poole railway station. From 1860 to 1966,  was a stop on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which ran from Bath to Bournemouth, though until the bridge was built over the river Stour, opening in 1863, the Dorset Central section of the line terminated at the hamlet of Blandford St. Mary. Blandford Forum railway station, along with the whole line, closed to passengers in 1966. Located between  and Broadstone, the railway was still open until the closure of the Blandford's goods yard in 1969, after which the track was lifted. The station was immortalised in 1964 in the song ""Slow Train"" by Flanders and Swann.

Blandford Camp was served by a short-lived three-mile branch line, which left the main line just north of the river bridge. This operated intermittently from 1918 to 1928.

Education
Blandford Forum has two primary schools: Archbishop Wake and Milldown. A new Archbishop Wake school, built on the old St Leonards Middle School site at the bottom of Black Lane, opened in November 2008. The other feeder schools for The Blandford School are Blandford St Mary, Downlands, Dunbury and Durweston, Pimperne, and Spetisbury Primary Schools. Pupils move at the age of 11 to The Blandford School, which is a secondary school lying in the west of Blandford; the school also has a sixth form.

Natural history

The Blandford fly (Simulium posticatum), a small (2–3 mm) biting fly belonging to the family Simuliidae or ""blackflies"" lives in the area. In recent years the weed beds in the river have been sprayed to reduce numbers.

Blandford Elm (Ulmus glabra Huds.  'Superba') is a (now rare) very large-leaved wych cultivar, first raised by nurseryman Gill of Blandford Forum in the early 1840s, and distributed by nurseries in the UK, Europe and the USA.  Only one specimen is known to survive (2020), in Edinburgh.

Notable residents
Blandford is the birthplace of three eighteenth-century bishops: William Wake (1657–1737), Archbishop of Canterbury; Thomas Lindesay (1656–1724), Archbishop of Armagh; and Samuel Lisle (1683–1749), Bishop of Norwich.

Frederick Abberline (1843–1929), the former chief inspector for the London Metropolitan Police during the hunt for Jack the Ripper, was born in Blandford.

18,"Boston Common (also known as the Common) is a central public park in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as the Boston Commons. Dating from 1634, it is the oldest city park in the United States. The Boston Common consists of  of land bounded by Tremont Street (139 Tremont St.), Park Street, Beacon Street, Charles Street, and Boylston Street. The Common is part of the Emerald Necklace of parks and parkways that extend from the Common south to Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and Dorchester. A visitors' center for all of Boston is located on the Tremont Street side of the park.

The Central Burying Ground is located on the Boylston Street side of Boston Common and contains the burial sites of the artist Gilbert Stuart and the composer William Billings. Also buried there are Samuel Sprague and his son, Charles Sprague, one of America's earliest poets. Samuel Sprague was a participant in the Boston Tea Party and fought in the Revolutionary War. The Common was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1977.

History

Boston Common originally included the entire block northeast of where Park Street is now, bounded by Beacon Street and Tremont Street.  What is now called the Granary Burying Ground was established on this land in 1660, as part of the Common.  In 1662, the land was separated from the Common; the southwest portion of the block was taken for public buildings including the Granary and a house of correction, and the north portion of the block was used for housing.

The Common's purpose has changed over the years. It was once owned by William Blaxton (often given the modernized spelling ""Blackstone""), the first European settler of Boston, until it was bought from him in 1634 by the Puritan founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During the 1630s, it was used by many families as a cow pasture. However, this only lasted for a few years, as affluent families bought additional cows, which led to overgrazing, a real-life example of the ""tragedy of the commons"". After grazing was limited in 1646 to 70 cows at a time, the Boston Common continued to host cows until they were formally banned from it in 1830 by Mayor Harrison Gray Otis.

The Common was used as a camp by the British before the American Revolutionary War, from which they left for the Battle of Lexington and Concord. It was used for public hangings up until 1817, most of which were from a large oak which was replaced with a gallows in 1769. On June 1, 1660, Quaker Mary Dyer was hanged there by the Puritans for repeatedly defying a law that banned Quakers from the Colony. Dyer was one of the four Quakers executed on the Common and known as the Boston martyrs.

On May 19, 1713, two hundred citizens rioted on the Common in reaction to a food shortage in the city. They later attacked the ships and warehouses of wealthy merchant Andrew Belcher, who was exporting grain to the British West Indies for higher profits. The lieutenant governor was shot during the riot.

True park status seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed. Renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Place (later to be called Park Street) in 1804 already acknowledged the reality. By 1836, an ornamental iron fence fully enclosed the Common and its five perimeter malls or recreational promenades, the first of which, Tremont Mall, had been in place since 1728, in imitation of St. James's Park in London. Given these improvements dating back to 1728, a case could be made that Boston Common is in fact the world's first public urban park, since these developments precede the establishment of the earliest public urban parks in England—Derby Arboretum (1840), Peel Park, Salford (1846), and Birkenhead Park (1847)—which are often considered the first. The park was originally ""out of bounds"" for Black and American Indian people, a restriction that was fought by the Black community in Boston until it was lifted on July 4, 1836.

Originally, the Charles Street side of Boston Common, along with the adjacent portions of the Public Garden, were used as an unofficial dumping ground, due to being the lowest-lying portions of the two parks; this, along with the Garden's originally having been a salt marsh, resulted in the portions of the two parks being ""a moist stew that reeked and that was a mess to walk over"", driving visitors away from these areas. Although plans had long been in place to regrade the Charles Street-facing portions of Boston Common and the Public Garden, the cost of moving the amount of soil necessary (approximately , weighing , for the Common, plus an additional , weighing , for the adjoining portions of the Public Garden) prevented the work from being undertaken. This finally changed in the summer of 1895, when the required quantity of soil was made available as a result of the excavation of the Tremont Street subway, and was used to regrade the Charles Street sides of both Boston Common and the Public Garden.

A hundred people gathered on the Common in early 1965 to protest the Vietnam War. A second protest happened on October 15, 1969, this time with 100,000 people protesting in the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam.

Today, the Common serves as a public park for all to use for formal or informal gatherings. Events such as concerts, protests, softball games, and ice skating (on Frog Pond) often take place in the park. Famous individuals such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Pope John Paul II have made speeches there. Judy Garland gave her largest concert ever (100,000+) on the Common, on August 31, 1967.

It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987. The Boston Common is a public park managed by the Boston Park Department and cared for by Friends of the Public Garden, a private advocacy group, which also provides additional funding for maintenance and special events.

Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech in the Common on May 31, 1990 on his way to Washington D.C. to sign agreements with U.S. President George H.W. Bush.

On October 21, 2006, the Common became the site of a new world record, when 30,128 Jack-o'-lanterns were lit simultaneously around the park at the Life is good Pumpkin Festival. The previous record, held by Keene, New Hampshire since 2003, was 28,952.

On August 27, 2007, two teenagers were shot on the Common. One of the bullets fired during the shooting struck the Massachusetts State House. A strict curfew has since been enforced, which has been protested by the homeless population of Boston.

On January 21, 2017, approximately 175,000 people marched from the common to the Back Bay vicinity to profess resistance to the anti-female viewpoints held by president Donald Trump.

On August 19, 2017, approximately 40,000 people marched from Roxbury Crossing to Boston Common to protest hate speech and white supremacy, in the wake of events in Charlottesville, VA the week before. A right-wing ""Free Speech"" rally had been planned on Boston Common, which some feared would draw members of the KKK, Neo Nazis and other hate groups. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh deemed the ""Fight Supremacy"" counter protest a great success.

Notable features

Grounds

The Common forms the southern foot of Beacon Hill. Boston Common is the southern end of Boston's Freedom Trail.

The Boston Common Frog Pond sits at the heart of Boston Common. Managed by The Skating Club of Boston in partnership with the City of Boston, Frog Pond is home to a winter ice skating rink and learn-to-skate school, a reflecting pool in the spring and fall, and a summer spray pool and children's carousel.

The softball fields lie in the southwest corner of the Common. A grassy area forms the western part of the park and is most commonly used for the park's largest events. A parking garage lies under this part of the Common. A granite slab there commemorates Pope John Paul II's October 1, 1979 visit to Boston.  The Pope said mass that day to an estimated 400,000 people.

In 1913 and 1986, prehistoric sites were discovered on the Common indicating Native American presence in the area as far back as 8,500 years ago.

Since 1971, the Province of Nova Scotia has donated the annual Christmas Tree to the City of Boston as an enduring thank-you for the relief efforts of the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee following the Halifax Explosion of 1917.

21,"The Beaufort Sea (; , Iñupiaq: Taġiuq) is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located north of the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, and Alaska, and west of Canada's Arctic islands. The sea is named after Sir Francis Beaufort, a hydrographer. The Mackenzie River, the longest in Canada, empties into the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea west of Tuktoyaktuk, which is one of the few permanent settlements on the sea's shores.

The sea, characterized by severe climate, is frozen over most of the year. Historically, only a narrow pass up to  opened in August–September near its shores, but recently due to climate change in the Arctic the ice-free area in late summer has greatly enlarged. Until recently, the Beaufort Sea was known as an important reservoir for the replenishment of Arctic sea ice. Sea ice would often rotate for several years in the Beaufort Gyre, the dominant ocean current of the Beaufort Sea, growing into sturdy and thick multi-year ice.

Claims that the seacoast was populated about 30,000 years ago have been largely discredited (see below); present population density is very low. The sea contains significant resources of petroleum and natural gas under its shelf, such as the Amauligak field. They were discovered in the period between the 1950s and 1980s, and since the latter part of that period their exploration has become the major human activity in the area. The traditional occupations of fishery and whale and seal hunting are practiced only locally, and have no commercial significance. As a result, the sea hosts one of the largest colonies of beluga whales, and there is no sign of overfishing. To prevent overfishing in its waters, the US adopted precautionary commercial fisheries management plan in August 2009. In April 2011 the Canadian government signed a memorandum of understanding with the Inuvialuit as a first step in developing a larger ocean management plan. The Canadian government announced in October 2014 that no new commercial fisheries in the Beaufort Sea will be considered until research has shown sustainable stocks that would be made available to Inuvialuit first.

The Canadian government designated blocks of the Beaufort Sea as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam MPA surrounds the Parry Peninsula in the Amundsen Gulf, and the Tarium Niryutait MPA is located at the Mackenzie River delta and estuary. The protected areas are set to protect species and habitats for the Inuvialuit community.

Extent
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Beaufort Sea as follows:
On the North. A line from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Lands End, Prince Patrick Island ().

On the East. From Lands End through the Southwest coast of Prince Patrick Island to Griffiths Point, thence a line to Cape Prince Alfred, the Northwestern extreme of Banks Island, through its West coast to Cape Kellet, the Southwestern point, and thence a line to Cape Bathurst on the mainland ().

Border dispute

There is an unresolved dispute involving a wedge-shaped slice on the International Boundary in the Beaufort Sea, between the Canadian territory of Yukon and the U.S. state of Alaska. Canada claims the maritime boundary to be along the 141st meridian west out to a distance of , following the Alaska–Yukon land border. The position of the United States is that the boundary line is perpendicular to the coast out to a distance of , following a line of equidistance from the coast. This difference creates a wedge with an area of about  that is claimed by both nations.

Canada's position has its roots in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) between the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire that set the boundary between the two. Canada is the successor state to Great Britain in relation to this treaty, which stipulates:

Canada maintains that this treaty is extensible from the land into the Beaufort Sea along the meridian.  The United States rejects this extension and instead asserts a boundary line based upon equidistance, although its position is somewhat undermined by its acceptance in 1867 of similar treaty wording and a similar interpretation under the treaty whereby it acquired Alaska. Both the U.S. and Canada agree that they are bound by the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf; and they both agree that the boundary should be ""equitable"", as determined by the International Court of Justice. They differ on what should be deemed ""equitable"". The U.S. contends that ""equidistance is an appropriate principle for determining a maritime boundary where there are no special circumstances in the area and when equidistance results in a boundary in accordance with equitable principles"". Canada contends that an equidistance principle does not result in an equitable boundary, because distortion would occur. The coast of Yukon is concave, whereas the coast of Alaska is convex; and thus an equidistance principle would result in a significant extension of the U.S. possession. This dispute has taken on increased significance due to the possible presence of natural reserves within the wedge, which according to Canada's National Energy Board may contain  of gas, which would cover the national consumption for 20 years, and more than  of oil. Because of this, Canada argues that ""special circumstances"" apply to this border, a position that the U.S. rejects. This dispute is in this respect a mirror image of the dispute between the U.S. and Canada over the Gulf of Maine, where the U.S. argued for ""special circumstances"" and Canada argued for the equidistance principle. (In that latter dispute, both of those arguments were rejected, and the border was drawn based upon geometric principles taking into account geographic factors.) Neither the U.S. nor Canada has pressed for a swift resolution for the matter, or arbitration at the International Court of Justice, however; and the two have in the meantime cooperated in several measures aimed at preserving the maritime environment.

Before the end of 2004, the US leased eight plots of land below the water for oil exploration and exploitation, provoking a diplomatic protest from Canada. On 20 August 2009, United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke announced a moratorium on commercial fishing of the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska, including the disputed waters. In July 2010, US–Canada negotiations have started in Ottawa with the next meeting planned in 2011. A joint geological survey of the area has been initiated, and the issue was marked as settled by the CIA World Factbook, though no official document has been released by September 2010.

Moratorium on commercial fishing
On August 20, 2009 United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke announced a moratorium on fishing the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska. According to Locke: 

There is no widespread commercial fisheries in those waters now.

The moratorium was imposed in anticipation that global warming would make those waters accessible to commercial fisheries.
The moratorium stirred controversy in Canada because the region where the USA announced the moratorium included a large wedge-shaped region of disputed waters. Randy Boswell, of Canada.com wrote that the disputed area covered a  section of the Beaufort Sea.
He wrote that Canada had filed a ""diplomatic note"" with the US in April when the USA first announced plans for the moratorium.  Jack Layton, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, called the U.S. moratorium over the disputed waters in the Beaufort Sea the ""largest encroachment on Canadian territory in our history.""

Geography

Several rivers such as the Kongakut River in Alaska and the Firth River in Yukon empty into the Beaufort. The major river to flow into the sea is the Mackenzie, Canada's longest, which empties into the Canadian part of the sea, west of Tuktoyaktuk. The coastal shelf area is rather narrow, especially near and east of Point Barrow in the Alaskan part of the sea, and contains numerous submarine valleys. It becomes wider near the delta of the Mackenzie River but nowhere exceeds . Near the coast, the depths are shallower than  but they rapidly increase northwards up to a few kilometers, transforming into a massive platform which is geologically similar to that of the oceans. There are many small islands in the sea and in the delta of the Mackenzie River. A few larger ones lie west of the Mackenzie River, such as Herschel Island ( off the shore, area ) and Barter Island ( from the coast, area ). The coasts are low, with the maximum elevations between . The soil is frozen all year around at the depth below about  or less, forming permafrost, and only the top few tens of centimeters thaws in summer. Consequently, buildings have to be elevated above ground on wooden piles that are immersed into the permafrost.

Hydrology and climate

The Beaufort Sea is frozen over through the year, except for August and September when the ice breaks near the coast and opens what was once a  wide strip of open water. During the 2000s, due to climate change in the Arctic, the ice-free area in late summer greatly enlarged. During the record minimum extent of Arctic sea ice in September, 2012, the sea ice boundary had retreated northward much farther than normal from the coast.

The channels of the Mackenzie River thaw earlier, in late May–early June. This thawing increases the average water discharge from about .

Hidden changes in the ice cover of the Beaufort Sea were discovered in 2009. Whereas the ice area remain stable, as detected by the observation satellites, so as the associated water temperature and salinity, the ice structure has changed recently. The new ice, called rotten ice, is thinner and much weaker structurally.

The sea water has a stable temperature and is separated into four distinct layers as follows. The top  are surface water which has a temperature of  in summer and  in winter. The next layer is formed by the inflows from the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea coming through the Bering Strait; it extends up to the North Pole. The warmest, deep Atlantic layer has the temperatures between 0 and 1 °C (32 to 34 °F), and water at the bottom is a bit colder at −0.4 to −0.8 °C (31.3 to 30.6 °F). The average salinity varies between 28‰ and 32‰ (parts per thousand) from south to north. Typical air temperatures (at Tuktoyaktuk) are  in January and  in July.

The water currents form the clockwise-directed Beaufort Gyre, that results in south-westerly and westerly currents near the shores. The Mackenzie River partly affects this circulation inducing minor eastwards streams near its mouth. The river annually brings about 15 million tonnes of sediments which are rich in dolomite and calcium carbonate. Those deposits are spread over the sea and mixed with mud and gravel.

Flora and fauna
The shoreline of the Beaufort Sea is covered with tundra and marks the northern limit of the terrestrial range of the polar bear in North America. The Mackenzie River is an important habitat for whales and seabirds and is still relatively untouched by commercial traffic. The delta of Mackenzie River contains numerous lakes and ponds which are inhabited by muskrat.

The sea hosts about 80 species of zooplankton, more than 70 species of phytoplankton, and nearly 700 species of polychaetes, bryozoans, crustaceans and mollusks, but their total volume is relatively small owing to the cold climate. Major fish species include polar cod (Boreogadus saida), Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis), saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis), least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis), inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) and flatfish.

The eastern part of the sea is a major habitat of beluga whales with an estimated population of 39,000. This population is stable and might even be increasing; it is not affected by the offshore oil exploration in the area. Belugas spend summer in the coastal area and Mackenzie River delta, which are free of ice then, and in winter migrate long distances to the polynyas of the deep sea. Genetic analyses have confirmed that belugas of the Beaufort Sea are clearly distinct from those of other Canadian and Alaskan waters, despite often sharing a common wintering habitat.

The food chain of the Beaufort Sea is relatively simple: It starts with phytoplankton and epontic algae (single-cell algae associated with the lower interface of sea ice), which provide energy to zooplankton, and epontic and coastal amphipods. The latter serve as a food for seabirds and fish, primarily as polar cod and Arctic char. Polar cod is a major food of Arctic char, beluga, narwhal, seabirds and seals, which are dominated by the bearded seal (Erignatus barbatus) and ringed seal (Pusa hispida). Bearded seal and walrus also feed on benthic invertebrates. On top of the food pyramid stands the polar bear, which feeds primarily on seals, but also on any large marine mammals when it has a chance, such as carcasses and whales trapped in ice fields.

Human activities

""There is only one proposed Early-Entry site in eastern Beringia that still has proponents, Bluefish Caves in the Porcupine River Basin, Yukon Territory, Canada. Claims of great antiquity in the area [e.g., 30kya] have a convoluted history. A caribou tibia flesher, the most diagnostic human implement from the Old Crow basin, had been dated at near 28 kya. When redated using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of small amounts of remnant collagen the bone produced a 1.8 kya date (Yesner 1996b:255)"". There is no evidence for anomalous occupation of Beaufort coasts in the context of Arctic cultures generally, including the arrival about 4,000 years ago by Paleo-Eskimos such as the Dorset culture, around 1,000 years ago by the Thule and finally by the modern Inuit. From early ages, they practiced fishing – bones of Arctic char were found at the 4,000 years old settlements. While originally they lived nomadic life, later, they started to form permanent settlements. Modern Inuit are mostly concentrated near the Mackenzie River delta. Their population is increasing, but the unemployment rate is relatively high.Bowhead whales were hunted in the sea between 1888 and 1914. This practice stopped, first because of the decline in whale population and then because of government regulations, but resumed in the 1990s.

The major settlements along the Beaufort Sea are Tuktoyaktuk (population 930 in 2009) in Canada and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Although Prudhoe Bay is permanently populated by only a few people, there are thousands of contract workers in the area employed on petroleum production at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, which is on the coastal lowland known as the North Slope. Artificial islands, such as Endicott and Northstar, have been raised near the shores in 1987 and 2001, respectively. The crude oil is transported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to the southern port of Valdez.

Fishing and sea hunting are practised by the local inhabitants and have no commercial value, especially after a US moratorium on commercial fishing of the Beaufort Sea, adopted in 2009. Trapping of muskrat at the Mackenzie River delta was the main source of income for the Athabaskan First Nations peoples and Inuit during 1920–1960, but has since declined.

Oil and gas exploration
The Beaufort Sea contains major gas and petroleum reserves beneath the seabed, a continuation of proven reserves in the nearby Mackenzie River and North Slope. The Beaufort Sea was first explored for sub-shelf hydrocarbons in the 1950s and estimated to contain about  of oil and  of natural gas under its coastal shelf. Offshore drilling began in 1972; about 70 wells were set up by the 1980s and 200 wells by 2000. These activities resulted in dredging of about 46.5 million m3 of sea bottom soil, as well as discharge of drilling muds which contained barite, clay, caustic soda, and heavy metals zinc, copper, lead, chromium, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and mercury. About  of oil was produced in 1986.

A major gas field, named Taglu Gas Field, was discovered in the Mackenzie River delta in 1971, followed by the Parson Lake field and Niglintgak field. The estimated gas reserves of these fields are ,  and , respectively. Moreover, further into the sea from the Mackenzie delta lies the Amauligak field. This, the largest known oil deposit of the Beaufort Sea, was discovered in 1984, and is estimated to contain  of oil and  of gas. The development of these fields is hindered by their remote location. This problem was alleviated for Prudhoe Bay by constructing the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, but is limiting regular commercial production at Mackenzie River deposits. For example, the Amauligak Project was started soon after the discovery of the field. In September 1985, the tanker Gulf Beaufort has transported  of crude oil to Japan, which was the first shipment of oil from the Arctic deposits. However, the project has stalled after that.

In July 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved a plan to allow Eni, an Italian multinational oil and gas company, to drill four oil exploration wells on Spy Island, one of four artificial islands in the Beaufort Sea.

22,"A centreboard or centerboard (US) is a retractable keel which pivots out of a slot in the hull of a sailboat, known as a centreboard trunk (UK) or centerboard case (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of solely a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.

The analog in a scow is a bilgeboard: these are fitted in pairs and used one at a time.

Lt. John Schank (c. 1740 – 6 February 1823) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and is credited with the invention of the centerboard.  Schank, however, gave credit for the idea to British Brigadier General Earl Percy.

Function
A centreboard (often called a lifting foil in a modern racing dinghy) is used to provide lift to counter the lateral force from the sails.  This is required for sailboats to move in directions other than downwind, since the force of the sail is never closer than 45 degrees to the apparent wind.  Since most sailboats are symmetric along their axis of motion, when sailing upright, the lateral force can come from either side, which means that centreboards must use symmetric foil shapes so they will operate with equal efficiency on either tack. The more a yacht heels the more asymmetric its hull shape becomes.

The centerboard, daggerboard or bilgeboard can be used as a recovery platform upon which to stand, providing increased leverage, in the event the dinghy overturns via a capsize or turtle.

Design
The efficiency of a centreboard improves with increasing aspect ratio. A long narrow centreboard produces less drag than a short, wide one for a given amount of lift, resulting in a faster boat that can point closer into the wind. A fore and aft, pivoting centreboard can also be used to move the centre of lateral resistance aft to match a change in sail plan, such as furling or dropping the jib. A retracting centreboard is more complex than a fixed keel, and most take up space inside the hull of the boat that could otherwise be used for passenger accommodation. Other types feature a casing under the boat, which does not take up space but instead has the problem of increased drag. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find boats with a combination of shallow keel and centreboard (e.g. Randmeer). The keel provides the housing for the centreboard, moving it out of the hull, but adds only a small amount of draft to the boat. The centreboard can then be lowered in deeper waters to increase the amount of lift.  Ballast is usually provided in the keel, keeping the centreboard lighter and easier to handle.

Centreboards are often ballasted in keelboats and called ""lifting keels"". Ballasted centreboards are generally not locked in place when lowered; the mass of the ballast keeps them down. This also provides a measure of safety should the boat run aground—the force of impact will push the foil back into the centreboard trunk, rather than breaking it, as might happen if the board were locked in place. The mass of a ballasted foil means that a system of pulleys may be required to allow the sailor to lift the foil, and a method of latching the board in the upward position is needed. A centreboard differs from a ballast keel in that centreboards do not contribute to the stability of the vessel; their purpose is to provide lateral resistance. In small sailing dinghies it is rare to find a ballasted centreboard.

On larger sailing vessels, a similar design is sometimes incorporated to facilitate better navigation in shallow water than a fixed keel would allow. In these situations the appendage is generally referred to as a ""lifting keel"" (which is usually pivoted but occasionally retracted like a daggerboard) or a ""swing keel"".

In such installations on offshore vessels, the keel should ideally be lockable in any position, so that it does not fall back into the keel well if the vessel is inverted.

When the craft is moving, the centreboard acts as a lifting foil.

23,"Karl Emil Julius Ulrich Salchow (7 August 1877 – 19 April 1949) was a Danish-born Swedish figure skater, who dominated the sport in the first decade of the 20th century.

Salchow won the World Figure Skating Championships ten times, from 1901 to 1905, and from 1907 to 1911. This is still a record, which he shares with Sonja Henie who also won 10 titles in the 1920s and 1930s, and with Irina Rodnina who won 10 titles in the 1960s and 1970s.  Salchow did not compete in the 1906 World Championships that were held in Munich, as he feared that he would not be judged fairly against Gilbert Fuchs of Germany. When figure skating was first contested at the Summer Olympic Games in London (1908), Salchow also won the title with ease, became one of the oldest figure skating Olympic champions. In addition, Salchow won the European Championships a record nine times (1898–1900, 1904, 1906–1907, 1909–1910, 1913) and placed second in the World Championships three times.

In 1909, Ulrich Salchow first landed a jump in competition in which he took off on the back inside edge, and landed on the back outside edge of his other foot. This jump is now known as the Salchow jump in his honor.

After his competitive days, Salchow remained active in the sport, and was president of the International Skating Union (ISU) from 1925 to 1937. Furthermore, he was the chairman of AIK in Stockholm between 1928 and 1939 – the leading Swedish club in football, ice-hockey, bandy, tennis and other sports.

Ulrich Salchow was married to the dentist Dr. Anne-Elisabeth Salchow.

Salchow died in Stockholm at the age of 71 and was interred there at Norra begravningsplatsen.

24,"Quarry Bank Mill (also known as Styal Mill) in Styal, Cheshire, England, is one of the best preserved textile factories of the Industrial Revolution.  Built in 1784, the cotton mill is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Quarry Bank Mill was established by Samuel Greg, and was notable for innovations both in machinery and also in its approach to labour relations, the latter largely as a result of the work of Greg's wife, Hannah Lightbody. The family took a somewhat paternalistic attitude toward the workers, providing medical care for all and limited education to the children, but all laboured roughly 72 hours per week until 1847 when a new law shortened the hours.

Greg also built housing for his workers, in a large community now known as Styal Estate. Some were conversions of farm houses, or older residences but 42 new cottages, including the Oak Cottages (now Grade II Listed), were built in the 1820s when the mill was being expanded.

The National Trust, which runs the mill and Styal Estate as a museum that is open to the public, calls the site ""one of Britain's greatest industrial heritage sites, home to a complete industrial community"". According to the Council of Europe, the mill with Styal village make up ""the most complete and least altered factory colony of the Industrial Revolution. It is of outstanding national and international importance"".

Location
Quarry Bank Mill is on the outskirts of Styal in Cheshire, abutting and to the south of Manchester Airport.
The mill is on the bank of the River Bollin which provided water to power the waterwheels. It was connected by road to the Bridgewater Canal for transporting raw cotton from the port of Liverpool. The site consisted of three farms or folds. Styal railway station opened in 1909, about a kilometre away.

History

Samuel Greg leased land at Quarrell Hole on Pownall Fee from Lord Stamford, who imposed a condition that ""none of the surrounding trees should be pruned, felled or lopped""; maintaining the woodland character of the area. One reason for selecting this location was the ""suitable head of water provided by the River Bollin and its proximity to the Bridgewater Canal and thus Liverpool"". The factory was built in 1784 by Greg to spin cotton. When Greg retired in 1832 it was the largest such business in the United Kingdom. The water-powered Georgian mill still produces cotton calico. The Gregs were careful and pragmatic, paternalistic millowners, and the mill was expanded and changed throughout its history. When Greg's son, Robert Hyde Greg, took over the business, he introduced weaving. Samuel Greg died in 1834.

An 1835 report provided these specifics about the mill: ""It is driven by an elegant water-wheel, thirty-two feet in diameter, and twenty-four feet broad, equivalent in power to one
hundred and twenty horses""

The Mill was attacked during the Plug Plot riots on 10 August 1842.

The mill's iron water wheel, the fourth to be installed, was designed by Thomas Hewes and built between 1816 and 1820.  Overhead shafts above the machines were attached to the water wheel by a belt. When the wheel turned, the motion moved the belt and powered the machinery. A beam engine and a horizontal steam engine were subsequently installed to supplement the power. The Hewes wheel broke in 1904 but the River Bollin continued to power the mill through two water turbines. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river's water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years. Steam engines could produce power all year round. Today the mill houses the most powerful working waterwheel in Europe, an iron wheel moved from Glasshouses Mill at Pateley Bridge designed by Sir William Fairbairn who had been Hewes' apprentice.

Mill community
The sparse accommodation that existed when the Gregs built the mill was soon exhausted and Greg built plain cottages, including the Oak Cottages which are now Grade II listed; these were rented to his workers. Each house had a parlour, kitchen and two bedrooms (a two-up two-down), an outside privy and a small garden. Rent was deducted from the workers' wages. The area of worker housing became known as Styal Estate.

The Gregs owned a home in Manchester but also built a home near the mill in 1797, called ""Quarry Bank House"". The building has been Grade II listed since 1975. It was restored in 2017 in a manner that ensured that ""all primary features dating from the Greg family’s occupation have been retained"", and was opened to visits by the public by the National Trust.

Samuel Greg, like Robert Owen, who built New Lanark, attempted to bring the structured order of a country village to his new industrial centres. He built Oak School to educate the children and the Norcliffe Chapel where the villagers worshipped and held a Sunday school.

At first, Greg converted farm buildings in Styal to house workers. As the mill increased in size, new housing was constructed for the workers. According to the National Trust, in the 1820s, ""... new terraced cottages brought a brand new style of architecture and an expanding population ... In the tiny two-up-two-down cottages workers lived in cramped conditions, with as many as 14 people living in one house and tenants sub-letting rooms to other mill workers"".

The Gregs also built the village shop and, for roughly five decades, remained the owners.

Medical care for mill workers was provided by staff physicians and surgeons. The mill provided the ""earliest recorded occupational health service in this country"", according to an article in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine.

Apprentice system

Quarry Bank Mill employed child apprentices, a system that continued only until 1847. Most were children of families in poverty, living in workhouses, which sent them to the mill which was ""clamouring for cheap labour"". At the time, the consensus was that the children were better off in labour than they would have been under 'the step-motherly care of the Poor Law'"", according to a reliable source. Initially, the children were brought from Hackney and Chelsea but by 1834 they came mostly from neighbouring parishes or Liverpool poorhouses.

The last child to be indentured started work in 1841. Child labour, constituted over half of the labour force in the early decades of the mill's operation, according to Prof Hannah Barker, chair of Manchester Histories at the University of Manchester. ""By 1833 apprentices made up only 20% of workforce at Styal, and in 1847 the apprentice system was completely abandoned"".

The first children apprentices lived in lodgings in the neighbourhood then in 1790 Greg built the  Apprentice House near the factory. Greg believed he could get the best out of his workers by treating them fairly. He hired a superintendent to attend to their care and morals and members of the Greg family and external tutors gave them lessons.

Some of the work was dangerous, with fingers sometimes being severed by the machines. Samuel Greg employed Peter Holland, father of the Royal Physician Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet and uncle of Elizabeth Gaskell, as mill doctor. Holland was responsible for the health of the children and other workers, and was the first doctor to be employed in such a capacity.

Life for the children was not ideal of course. Hours were long: 12 hours per day, six days a week, according to documents from 1794. Time for play was allowed only on Sunday afternoons. Still, their ""diet appears to have been a relatively good one"", according to Professor Barker's research, and some education was provided. (The Gregs were Unitarians who believed in educating their workers, including Sunday School for both sexes.) Initially, schooling was provided only for boys, for an hour on three evenings of the week, at most; by 1833 the mill claimed that girls were also getting some education on Sunday afternoons. A comparative study of child mill workers of the era by Katrina Honeyman indicated that ""those at Quarry Bank were treated 'better than average', but that the Gregs were not amongst the best employers in the country"".

A former director of the Quarry Bank Mill, and author of a book about Hannah Greg, provided this summary of child labour, based on extensive research.Over half of Samuel Greg’s workforce were poor and orphaned children ... the children were given good medical care by the Greg family doctor, and education in writing and maths three nights a week ... although the child workers were not subjected to corporal punishment, bad behaviour brought overtime, threats that girls would have their heads shaved or young workers being locked in a room for days on a porridge-only diet"".

20th and 21st century

The estate and mill were eventually inherited by Robert Hyde Greg  and then by Alexander Carlton Greg, who donated the site in 1939 to the National Trust. The mill continued in production until 1959. According to the historic listing, the 32 ft. diameter waterwheel was replaced by two turbines in 1904. Some restoration was completed in 1969.

In 2006 the National Trust acquired Quarry Bank House and its gardens and, in 2010, the gardener's house and the upper gardens. In 2013 the mill received 130,000 visitors. In 2013, the trust launched an appeal to raise £1.4 million to restore a worker's cottage, a shop and the Greg's glasshouses and digitise records relating to Gregs and the mill workers.

During 2015–2020, the Quarry Bank Project improved the site for visitors with a £9.4 million restoration. ""New areas have been restored and for the first time ever visitors can now explore the complete industrial heritage site at Quarry Bank"". A promotional video published by the Trust depicts scenes and activities that visitors can experience.

Architecture

Quarry Bank is an example of an early, rural, cotton-spinning mill that was initially dependent on water power. The first mill was built by Samuel Greg and John Massey in 1784. Its design was functional and unadorned, growing out of the pragmatism of the men who felt no need to make a bold architectural statement. It was a four-storey mill measuring  by , with an attached staircase, counting house and warehouse. It was designed to use water frames which had just come out of patent, and the increased supply of cotton caused by the cessation of the American War of Independence. The water wheel was at the north end of the mill.

The mill was extended in 1796 when it was doubled in length and a fifth floor added. A second wheel was built at the southern end. The mill was extended between 1817 and 1820 and a mansard-roofed wing extended part of the 1796 building forward beneath which the wheel was installed. The new building kept the 1784 detailing with respect to line and windows. The 1784 mill ran 2425 spindles, after 1805 with the new wheel it ran 3452 spindles.

Weaving sheds were added in 1836 and 1838 and they were of two storeys and housed 305 looms. Before the 1830s, spinning mills produced cotton, that was put-out to hand-loom weavers who worked in their own homes or small loom shops, like the one Greg owned at Eyam. Hand-loom weaving continued in parallel to power loom weaving throughout the 19th century. Around 1830 the power loom became sufficiently viable for independent weaving sheds to be set up, and for larger owners to add weaving sheds to their spinning mills. A weaving shed needed the correct light and humidity and a floor that was stable enough to withstand the vibration caused by the picking of many looms. Quarry Bank Mill is of national significance in that it used two-storey side-lit buildings rather the a single storey sheds with a saw-tooth roof. The first two-storey shed at Quarry Bank was  by . The 1838 building was  by  to which a storey was added in 1842 for warping and beaming. In the Gregs pragmatic way, looms were purchased gradually.

Water power
The first wheel was a wooden overshot wheel taking water by means of a long leat from upstream on the River Bollin. The second wheel built by Peter Ewart in 1801 was wooden. To increase power he dammed the Bollin and took water into the mill directly, the tailrace leaving the river below the dam. The third wheel of 1807 was a replacement for one of the wooden wheels. It is believed it was a suspension wheel,  in diameter made from iron to the design of Thomas Hewes.

The fourth wheel, the Great Wheel was also designed by Hewes. The challenge was to increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to below the level of the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant's Castle. This gave a head of  acting on the  diameter suspension wheel- which is  wide. The Great Wheel operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904.

In 1905 two water turbines built by Gilbert Gilkes and Company were installed to replace the Great Wheel. They used the same head and tail race and operated until 1959. When the mill was restored  in 1983, a  diameter waterwheel of similar design to that of Hewes by his pupil Sir William Fairbairn, was moved from Glasshouses Mill in Pateley Bridge and installed to provide power to work the machinery.

Steam power
Water flow from the Bollin was unreliable so an auxiliary steam engine was procured in 1810. It was a 10 hp beam engine from Boulton and Watt. In 1836 with the arrival of power looms a second 20 hp Boulton and Watt beam engine was acquired. The first horizontal condensing engine was acquired in 1871. A new engine house was built. In 1906 the 1871 engine was replaced by a second-hand 60 hp engine. The engines no longer exist and the museum has purchased a similar steam engine to display.

Profiting from the slave trade
The Gregs were involved in the triangular trade. Samuel Greg's brother-in-law, Thomas Hodgson, owned a slave ship, his father Thomas Greg and his brother John Greg part owned sugar plantations on the Caribbean island of Dominica. The best documented is Hillsborough Estate, Dominica which Samuel Greg and his brother Thomas inherited in 1795. In 1818 it had 71 male and 68 female slaves.

A research document states that ""although [Samuel] Greg did not rely on Caribbean estate earnings to finance entry into cotton spinning, his interest in plantations formed part of a wider family engagement in commerce that included significant slave-related business"". ""Samuel Greg ... his father Thomas and uncle John had interests in four estates in Dominica and St Vincent, ... while Samuel and his brother Thomas inherited the Hillsborough plantation in Dominica and other estates"", according to a news item. The research document also confirms that Samuel Greg's brothers were owners of estates, in the West Indies, where labour was provided by slaves.

In 2020, the National Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the owners of its properties, including the Quarry Bank Mill, who had links to colonialism and slavery. Visitors will find information about the ""histories of slavery and colonialism"" at the site.

In popular culture
The relationship between mill owners and employees at Quarry Bank, starting in 1833, was explored in the 2013–2014 television series The Mill. The producers used stories from the archives of the mill; the ten episodes were based on the stories but included some fictional characters. 

Some of the exteriors were filmed at the Quarry Bank Mill while others in the city centre of Chester and at Chester Crown Court.  
Interiors of the work in the mill were filmed in Manchester because ""the real factory floor couldn’t be easily converted from its contemporary function as a museum"". 

In 2020, some scenes for the ITV series Belgravia were filmed at the mill.

25,"The Dodge Dynasty is a mid-size car that was marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler Corporation from the 1988 to 1993 model years.  Developed as the successor of the Dodge 600 sedan, the Dynasty was slotted below the Diplomat (and its Monaco successor) in the Dodge sedan model line.  Through its production, the model line was offered solely as a four-door sedan.

The Dynasty uses the front-wheel drive Chrysler C/AC platform, an extended-wheelbase version of the Chrysler K-chassis; the Dynasty shares its body with the 1988-1993 Chrysler New Yorker.  The 1990-1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue and Chrysler Imperial are extended-wheelbase versions, using the Chrysler Y platform (the longest-wheelbase sedan variant of the K-car).

The Dynasty was assembled by Chrysler at its Belvidere Assembly Plant (Belvidere, Illinois) alongside the Chrysler New Yorker, New Yorker Fifth Avenue, and Imperial; the final vehicle was produced on May 28, 1993.  For the 1993 model year, the Dodge Intrepid was introduced and would replace both the Dynasty and the Monaco.

History

Origin of name 
The Dodge Dynasty name is believed to be a reference to the popular 1980s primetime ABC-TV series, ""Dynasty."" In fact, one magazine declared, ""Blake and Krystle, your car is ready,"" when the car debuted for the 1988 model year. However, it is most likely that Chrysler named its late 1980s and early 1990s C-Bodied cars on a ""royalty"" theme, which stemmed from the classic Imperial badge to attract customers, including the Chrysler Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue and the standard Chrysler New Yorker. The Dynasty was considered the budget automobile of the three, with the standard New Yorker in the middle and the Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue as the top-of-the-line model.

Model design 
Although it was fairly popular, the Lee Iacocca-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the Ford Taurus and the Chevrolet Lumina.  When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers, which greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car.  All models (1988-1993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. Dynasty trim levels included base, Premium (1988 only) and LE. Additionally, a ""Brougham"" package was offered on 1992-93 LE models that added a padded ""landau"" vinyl roof.

Specifications

A 2.5-litre inline-4 Chrysler engine (base model only), a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0-litre V6, the 6G72 engine, and a Chrysler-built 3.3-litre V6 were available, although the 3.3 L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0 L in 1988. The 1988 3.0L V6 models with TorqueFlite transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. The 1989-1990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991 to 1993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder & 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. Also, the 3.0 engine is a non-interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, it is less likely to damage valves and pistons when it does so.

The new 3.3L V6 engine for 1990, with the Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. The new electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, known as the Ultradrive or A604 (List of Chrysler transmissions), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG.  The new 3.3L V6 engine for 1990, with the Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG.

Features
The vast majority of Dynastys sold new to private customers had V6 engines, while four-cylinder base Dynastys were primarily sold to fleets. Dynasty models were all equipped with a driver's side airbag starting in 1990.  A Bendix anti-lock braking system (including 4-wheel disc brakes) was available on V6 models during those years as well at a list price of ~$900. The 1993 models were the only year to feature a stainless steel exhaust system and a tamper-proof odometer.

The 1988 LE models featured rear headrests, but were deleted for 1989 to 1993. Early production models (1988-1990) featured standard cornering lamps and remote fuel door release even on base trim models. By 1991-1993 those features were gradually removed from all Dodge passenger cars. By 1993, the only Dodge products that offered a remote fuel door release were the minivans and trucks, but in the late 1980s, this was standard on every Chrysler Corporation car including the Omni and Horizon twins. The base models lost cornering lamps for 1991, and the LE models lost them for 1992.

Leather seats were optional on the LE models, but very few were so equipped.  Also available were load-leveling suspension, 14-inch alloy wheels, wire wheel covers, illuminated entry system, Infinity stereo with equalizer and power antenna, power trunk pull-down, dual 6-way power seats with memory for driver's seat and outside mirrors.

Premium (1988 only)
LE (1988-1993)

International versions

In Canada and Mexico, Chrysler marketed the model line under the Chrysler Dynasty nameplate.   Chrysler of Canada replaced the Dodge 600 with the Dodge Spirit, with the Chrysler Dynasty replacing the Chrysler LeBaron GTS hatchback (and ultimately, the Dodge Diplomat, as the Dodge Monaco was not marketed in Canada).

Within the model line, the Dynasty was slotted between the LeBaron sedan and the New Yorker.  Largely identical to the base-trim Chrysler New Yorker Salon introduced in 1990, the Chrysler Dynasty received its own grille.  In Canada, both four-cylinder and V6 engines were offered; only V6 engines were offered in Mexico.

27,"Melanoma, also redundantly known as malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.

The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.

Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread (metastasis). Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment, the five-year survival rates in the United States are 99% among those with localized disease, 65% when the disease has spread to lymph nodes, and 25% among those with distant spread. The likelihood that melanoma will reoccur or spread depends on its thickness, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down.

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it newly occurred in 232,000 people. In 2015,  3.1 million people had active disease, which resulted in 59,800 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the United States, melanoma occurs about 1.6 times more often in men than women. Melanoma has become more common since the 1960s in areas mostly populated by people of European descent.

Signs and symptoms
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may itch, ulcerate, or bleed. Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic ""ABCDEF"":
Asymmetry
Borders (irregular with edges and corners)
Colour (variegated)
Diameter (greater than , about the size of a pencil eraser)
Evolving over time

This classification does not apply to nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:
Elevated above the skin surface
Firm to the touch
Growing
Metastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Metastasis (spread) of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare; less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma. It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen, or distant lymph nodes.

Cause
Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to UV light from the sun. Genetics also play a role. Melanoma can also occur in skin areas with little sun exposure (i.e. mouth, soles of feet, palms of hands, genital areas). People with dysplastic nevus syndrome, also known as familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma.

Having more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk melanoma might arise. A weakened immune system makes cancer development easier due to the body's weakened ability to fight cancer cells.

UV radiation
The UV radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are ""carcinogenic to humans"" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.

Those who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV.

UVB light (wavelengths between 315 and 280 nm) from the sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine, or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a DNA strand. Somewhat similarly to UVB, UVA light (longer wavelengths between 400 and 315 nm) from the sun or from tanning beds can also be directly absorbed by skin DNA (at about 1/100 to 1/1000 of the efficiency of UVB).

Exposure to radiation (UVA and UVB) is one of the major contributors to the development of melanoma. Occasional extreme sun exposure (resulting in ""sunburn"") is causally related to melanoma. Melanoma is most common on the back in men and on legs in women (areas of intermittent sun exposure). The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more common in professional and administrative workers than unskilled workers. Other factors are mutations in or total loss of tumor suppressor genes. Use of sunbeds (with deeply penetrating UVA rays) has been linked to the development of skin cancers, including melanoma.

Possible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of skin pigmentation. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from Northern Europe who have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight to which the skin of the settlers is not adapted, most notably Australia. Exposure during childhood is a more important risk factor than exposure in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia.

Having multiple severe sunburns increases the likelihood that future sunburns develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage. The sun and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.

Genetics
A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, greatly increase melanoma susceptibility. Several genes increase risks. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called MC1R that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk. Genetic testing can be used to search for the mutations.

One class of mutations affects the gene CDKN2A. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in 50% of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum  (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).

Familial melanoma  is genetically heterogeneous, and loci for familial melanoma appear on the chromosome arms 1p, 9p and 12q. Multiple genetic events have been related to melanoma's pathogenesis (disease development). The multiple tumor suppressor 1 (CDKN2A/MTS1) gene encodes p16INK4a – a low-molecular weight protein inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) – which has been localised to the p21 region of human chromosome 9. FAMMM is typically characterized by having 50 or more combined moles in addition to a family history of melanoma. It is transmitted autosomal dominantly and mostly associated with the CDKN2A mutations. People who have CDKN2A mutation associated FAMMM have a 38 fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

Other mutations confer lower risk, but are more common in the population. People with mutations in the MC1R gene are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies. MC1R mutations are very common, and all red-haired people have a mutated copy. Mutation of the MDM2 SNP309 gene is associated with increased risks for younger women.

Fair- and red-haired people, persons with multiple atypical nevi or dysplastic nevi and persons born with giant congenital melanocytic nevi are at increased risk.

A family history of melanoma greatly increases a person's risk, because mutations in several genes have been found in melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one melanoma are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor.

Fair skin is the result of having less melanin in the skin, which means less protection from UV radiation exists. A family history could indicate a genetic predisposition to melanoma.

Pathophysiology

The earliest stage of melanoma starts when melanocytes begin out-of-control growth. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, when the tumor is less than 1 mm thick, and spreads at the level of the basal epidermis. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.

When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction – vertically up into the epidermis and into the papillary dermis – cell behaviour changes dramatically.

The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, in which individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. From this point on, melanoma is capable of spreading. The Breslow's depth of the lesion is usually less than , while the Clark level is usually 2.

The vertical growth phase (VGP) following is invasive melanoma. The tumor becomes able to grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or lymph vessels. The tumor thickness is usually more than , and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.

The host elicits an immunological reaction against the tumor during the VGP, which is judged by the presence and activity of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of development. In certain cases, the primary tumor is completely destroyed and only the metastatic tumor is discovered. About 40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to MAP kinase pathway.

An insult common to most cancers is damage to DNA.  UVA light mainly causes thymine dimers. UVA also produces reactive oxygen species and these inflict other DNA damage, primarily single-strand breaks, oxidized pyrimidines and the oxidized purine 8-oxoguanine (a mutagenic DNA change) at 1/10th, 1/10th, and 1/3rd the frequencies of UVA-induced thymine dimers, respectively.

If unrepaired, CPD photoproducts can lead to mutations by inaccurate translesion synthesis during DNA replication or repair. The most frequent mutations due to inaccurate synthesis past CPDs are cytosine to thymine (C>T) or CC>TT transition mutations. These are commonly referred to as UV fingerprint mutations, as they are the most specific mutation caused by UV, being frequently found in sun-exposed skin, but rarely found in internal organs. Errors in DNA repair of UV photoproducts, or inaccurate synthesis past these photoproducts, can also lead to deletions, insertions, and chromosomal translocations.

The entire genomes of 25 melanomas were sequenced. On average, about 80,000 mutated bases (mostly C>T transitions) and about 100 structural rearrangements were found per melanoma genome. This is much higher than the roughly 70 mutations across generations (parent to child). Among the 25 melanomas, about 6,000 protein-coding genes had missense, nonsense, or splice site mutations. The transcriptomes of over 100 melanomas has also been sequenced and analyzed. Almost 70% of all human protein-coding genes are expressed in melanoma. Most of these genes are also expressed in other normal and cancer tissues, with some 200 genes showing a more specific expression pattern in melanoma compared to other forms of cancer. Examples of melanoma specific genes are tyrosinase, MLANA, and PMEL.

UV radiation causes damage to the DNA of cells, typically thymine dimerization, which when unrepaired can create mutations in the cell's genes. This strong mutagenic factor makes cutaneous melanoma the tumor type with the highest number of mutations. When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading to the formation of a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells; studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor-2 in cancer progression.

Cancer stem cells may also be involved.

Gene mutations
Large-scale studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving initiation and development of cutaneous melanoma.

The most frequent mutation occurs in the 600th codon of BRAF (50% of cases). BRAF is normally involved in cell growth, and this specific mutation renders the protein constitutively active and independent of normal physiological regulation, thus fostering tumor growth. RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS and KRAS) are also recurrently mutated (30% of TCGA cases) and mutations in the 61st or 12th codons trigger oncogenic activity. Loss-of-function mutations often affect tumor suppressor genes such as NF1, TP53 and CDKN2A. Other oncogenic alterations include fusions involving various kinases such as BRAF, RAF1, ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK1., NTRK3 and MET BRAF, RAS, and NF1 mutations and kinase fusions are remarkably mutually exclusive, as they occur in different subsets of patients. Assessment of mutation status can, therefore, improve patient stratification and inform targeted therapy with specific inhibitors.

In some cases (3-7%) mutated versions of BRAF and NRAS undergo copy-number amplification.

Diagnosis

Looking at the area in question is the most common method of suspecting a melanoma. Moles that are irregular in color or shape are typically treated as candidates. To detect melanomas (and increase survival rates), it is recommended to learn to recognize them (see ""ABCDE"" mnemonic), to regularly examine moles for changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to consult a qualified physician when a candidate appears.

However, many melanomas present as lesions smaller than 6 mm in diameter, and all melanomas are malignant when they first appear as a small dot. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6 mm in diameter. Seborrheic keratosis may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to false alarms. Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination or with dermatoscopy.

Some advocate replacing ""enlarging"" with ""evolving"": moles that change and evolve are a concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer ""elevation"". Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.

In-person inspection of suspicious skin lesions is more accurate than visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions. When used by trained specialists, dermoscopy is more helpful to identify malignant lesions than use of the naked eye alone. Reflectance confocal microscopy may have better sensitivity and specificity than dermoscopy in diagnosing cutaneous melanoma but more studies are needed to confirm this result.

Ugly duckling
One method is the ""ugly duckling sign"". Correlation of common lesion characteristics is made. Lesions that deviate from the common characteristics are labeled an ""ugly duckling"", and a further professional exam is required. The ""Little Red Riding Hood"" sign suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect ""ugly ducklings"", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble nonmelanomas or are considered to be ""wolves in sheep's clothing"". These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas that do not present easy-to-observe color changes and variations. Their borders are often indistinct, complicating visual identification without a dermatoscope.

Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the ""ugly duckling"" sign, and are hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, dermatofibromas, or lentigines.

Biopsy
Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because of the possibility of sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.

Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes. The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

Histopathologic types

Melanoma is a type of neuroectodermal neoplasm. There are four main types of melanoma:

Other histopathologic types are:
Mucosal melanoma; When melanoma occurs on mucous membranes.
Desmoplastic melanoma
Melanoma with small nevus-like cells
Melanoma with features of a Spitz nevus
Uveal melanoma
Vaginal melanoma
Polypoid melanoma, a subclass of nodular melanoma.

In situ or invasive
A melanoma in situ has not invaded beyond the basement membrane, whereas an invasive melanoma has spread beyond it.

Some histopathological types of melanoma are inherently invasive, including nodular melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma, where the in situ counterpart to lentigo maligna melanoma is lentigo maligna. Lentigo maligna is sometimes classified as a very early melanoma, and sometimes a precursor to melanoma.

Superficial spreading melanomas and acral lentiginous melanomas can be either in situ or invasive, but acral lentiginous melanomas are almost always invasive.

Staging
Further context on cancer staging is available at TNM.

Metastatic melanomas can be detected by X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, PET and PET/CTs, ultrasound, LDH testing and photoacoustic detection. However, there is lack of evidence in the accuracy of staging of people with melanoma with various imaging methods.

Melanoma stages according to AJCC, 8th edition:
TX: Primary tumor thickness cannot be assessed (such as a diagnosis by curettage)
T0: No evidence of primary tumor (such as unknown primary or completely regressed melanoma)

Stage 1 and 2 require an N (lymph node) class of:
N0 – No regional metastases.

Stage 1, 2 and 3 require an M (metastasis status) of:
M0: No evidence of distant metastasis

Older systems include ""Clark level"" and ""Breslow's depth"", quantifying microscopic depth of tumor invasion.

Laboratory
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tests are often used to screen for metastases, although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates the metastatic spread of the disease to the liver.

It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases CT, MRI, PET, and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of the lymph nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S-100 protein marker.

HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors. The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.

HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

Prevention
There is no evidence to support or refute adult population screening for malignant melanoma.

Ultraviolet radiation
Minimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds), following sun protection measures and wearing sun protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, and broad-brimmed hats) can offer protection.

Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.

UV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another common and widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided. Although the risk of developing skin cancer through UV nail lamp use is low, it is still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp.

The body uses UV light to generate vitamin D so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half-hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn. Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.

Sunscreen
Sunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma. In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.

Concerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage.

Medications
A 2005 review found tentative evidence that statin and fibrate medication may decrease the risk of melanoma. A 2006 review however did not support any benefit.

Treatment

Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed. Controversy exists around trial evidence for sentinel lymph node biopsy; with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015. Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

Surgery

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with  margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually . Many surgeons consider  the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but  margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades. A 2009 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a small difference in survival rates favoring wide excision of primary cutaneous melanomas, but these results were not statistically significant.

Mohs surgery has been reported with cure rate as low as 77% and as high as 98.0% for melanoma-in-situ. CCPDMA and the ""double scalpel"" peripheral margin controlled surgery is equivalent to Mohs surgery in effectiveness on this ""intra-epithelial"" type of melanoma.

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the lymph nodes in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically (lymphadenectomy) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.

Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes is a widely used procedure when treating cutaneous melanoma.

Neither sentinel lymph node biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and have a 5-year survival rate of 97%. Because of these considerations, sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling may be used as auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.

If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional skin biopsy is the management of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2 mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue. To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1 mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow's thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5 cm, 1.0 cm, or 2 cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

Add on treatment
High-risk melanomas may require adjuvant treatment, although attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up to a year of high-dose interferon treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly. However, the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard adjuvant treatment for melanoma. A 2013 meta-analysis suggested that the addition of interferon alpha increased disease-free and overall survival for people with AJCC TNM stage II-III cutaneous melanoma. A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease quality of life.

In Europe, interferon is usually not used outside the scope of clinical trials.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy drugs such as Dacarbazine have been the backbone of metastatic melanoma treatment since FDA approval in 1975 however, its efficacy in terms of survival has never been proven in an RCT.

In people with locally advanced cutaneous malignancies and sarcoma, isolated limb infusion (ILI) has been found to be a minimally invasive and well-tolerated procedure for delivering regional chemotherapy.

Targeted therapy
Melanoma cells have mutations that allow them to survive and grow indefinitely in the body. Small-molecule targeted therapies work by blocking the genes involved in pathways for tumor proliferation and survival. The main treatments are BRAF, C-Kit and NRAS inhibitors. These inhibitors work to inhibit the downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and tumour development due to specific gene mutations. People can be treated with small-molecule targeted inhibitors if they are positive for the specific mutation. BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib and a MEK inhibitor trametinib are the most effective, approved treatments for BRAF positive melanoma. Melanoma tumors can develop resistance during therapy which can make therapy no longer effective, but combining the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors may create a fast and lasting melanoma therapy response.

A number of treatments improve survival over traditional chemotherapy. Biochemotherapy (chemotherapy with cytokines IL-2 and IFN-α) combined with BRAF inhibitors improved survival for people with BRAF positive melanoma. Biochemotherapy alone did not improve overall survival and had higher toxicity than chemotherapy. Combining multiple chemotherapy agents (polychemotherapy) did not improve survival over monochemotherapy. Targeted therapies result in relatively short progression-free survival (PFS) times. The therapy combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has a 3-year PFS of 23%, and 5-year PFS of 13%.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is aimed at stimulating the person's immune system against the tumor, by enhancing the body's own ability to recognize and kill cancer cells.  The current approach to treating melanoma with immunotherapy includes three broad categories of treatments including cytokines, immune check point inhibitors, and adoptive cell transfer. These treatment options are most often used in people with metastatic melanoma and significantly improves overall survival. However, these treatments are often costly. For example, one immune check point inhibitor treatment, pembrolizumab, costs $10,000 to US$12,000 for a single dose administered every 3 weeks.

Cytokine therapies used for melanoma include IFN-a and IL-2. IL-2 (Proleukin) was the first new therapy approved (1990 Europe, 1992 USA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 20 years. IL-2 may offer the possibility of a complete and long-lasting remission in this disease in a small percentage of people with melanoma. Intralesional IL-2 for in-transit metastases has a high complete response rate ranging from 40 to 100%. Similarly, IFN-a has shown only modest survival benefits and high toxicity, limiting its use as a stand-alone therapy.

Immune check point inhibitors include anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, CD40 agonists, anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, pidilizumab, and nivolumab) and PD-L1 antibodies. Evidence suggests that anti-PD-1 antibodies are more effective than anti-CTLA4 antibodies with less systemic toxicity. The five-year progression-free survival for immunotherapy with pembrolizumab is 21%. A therapeutic approach that includes the combination of different therapies improves overall survival and progression-free survival compared to treatment with the separate immunotherapy drugs alone.

Ongoing research is looking at treatment by adoptive cell transfer. Adoptive cell transfer refers to the application of pre-stimulated, modified T cells or dendritic cells and is presently used to minimize complications from graft-versus-host disease.

Lentigo maligna

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard ""bread-loafing"" technique of fixed tissue histology – result in a high ""false negative"" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If bread loafing is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in-situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment.

Mohs surgery has been done with cure rate reported to be as low as 77%, and as high as 95% by another author. The ""double scalpel"" peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods.

Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ (lentigo maligna) have resolved with an experimental treatment, imiquimod (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months. While some studies have suggested the adjuvant use of topical tazarotene, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend it and suggests that it increases topical inflammation, leading to lower patient compliance.

Radiation
Radiation therapy is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property of the maximum radiation dose occurring close to the skin surface. It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival. Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.
Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma.

Prognosis

Factors that affect prognosis include:
 tumor thickness in millimeters (Breslow's depth), 
 depth related to skin structures (Clark level), 
 type of melanoma, 
 presence of ulceration, 
 presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion, 
 presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (if present, prognosis is better), 
 location of lesion, 
 presence of satellite lesions, and 
 presence of regional or distant metastasis.

Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their thickness. Less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a wide local excision (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.

When melanomas have spread to the lymph nodes, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of malignant melanoma prognosis.

Stage IV melanoma, in which it has metastasized, is the most deadly skin malignancy: five-year survival is 22.5%. When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many months or even years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.

There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g., rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a pathology report might indicate.

About 200 genes are prognostic in melanoma, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is correlated to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times. Examples of unfavorable genes are MCM6 and TIMELESS; an example of a favorable gene is WIPI1.

An increased neutorphil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with worse outcomes.

Epidemiology

Globally, in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. It has become more common in the last 20 years in areas that are mostly Caucasian.

The rate of melanoma has increased in the recent years, but it is not clear to what extent changes in behavior, in the environment, or in early detection are involved.

Australia
Australia has a very high – and increasing – rate of melanoma. In 2012, deaths from melanoma occurred in 7.3–9.8 per 100,000 population. In Australia, melanoma is the third most common cancer in either sex; indeed, its incidence is higher than for lung cancer, although the latter accounts for more deaths. It is estimated that in 2012, more than 12,000 Australians were diagnosed with melanoma: given Australia's modest population, this is better expressed as 59.6 new cases per 100,000 population per year; >1 in 10 of all new cancer cases were melanomas. Melanoma incidence in Australia is matter of significance, for the following reasons:
Australian melanoma incidence has increased by more than 30 per cent between 1991 and 2009.
Australian melanoma age-standardised incidence rates were, as of 2008, at least 12 times higher than the world average.
Australian melanoma incidence is, by some margin, the highest in the world.
Overall age-standardised cancer incidence in Australia is the highest in the world, and this is attributable to melanoma alone. Age-standardised overall cancer incidence is similar to New Zealand, but there is a statistically-significant difference between Australia and all other parts of the developed world including North America, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean.

United States
In the United States about 9,000 people die from melanoma a year. In 2011 it affected 19.7 per 100,000, and resulted in death in 2.7 per 100,000.

In 2013:
71,943 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin, including 42,430 men and 29,513 women.
9,394 people in the United States died from melanomas of the skin, including 6,239 men and 3,155 women.
The American Cancer Society's estimates for melanoma incidence in the United States for 2017 are:
About 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women).
About 9,730 people are expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women).
Melanoma is more than 20 times more common in whites than in African Americans. Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 2.5% (1 in 40) for whites, 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for African Americans, and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Hispanics.

The risk of melanoma increases as people age. The average age of people when the disease is diagnosed is 63.

History

Although melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine Peruvian mummies, radiocarbon dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.

John Hunter is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a ""cancerous fungous excrescence"". The excised tumor was preserved in the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma.

The French physician René Laennec was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806.

The first English-language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820. In his later work in 1857 he remarked that there is a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (Eight Cases of Melanosis with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease). Norris was also a pioneer in suggesting a link between nevi and melanoma and the possibility of a relationship between melanoma and environmental exposures, by observing that most of his patients had pale complexions. He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.

The first formal acknowledgment of advanced melanoma as untreatable came from Samuel Cooper in 1840. He stated that the only chance for a cure depends upon the early removal of the disease (i.e., early excision of the malignant mole) ...'

More than one and a half centuries later this situation remains largely unchanged.

Terminology
The word melanoma came to English from 19th-century New Latin and uses combining forms derived from ancient Greek roots: melano- (denoting melanin) + -oma (denoting a tissue mass and especially a neoplasm), in turn from Greek μέλας melas, ""dark"", and -ωμα oma, ""process"". The word melanoma has a long history of being used in a broader sense to refer to any melanocytic tumor, typically, but not always malignant, but today the narrower sense referring only to malignant types has become so dominant that benign tumors are usually not called melanomas anymore and the word melanoma is now usually taken to mean malignant melanoma unless otherwise specified. Terms such as ""benign melanocytic tumor"" unequivocally label the benign types, and modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.

Research
Pharmacotherapy research for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma is ongoing.

Targeted therapies

In clinical research, adoptive cell therapy and gene therapy, are being tested.

Two kinds of experimental treatments developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), have been used in metastatic melanoma with tentative success.

The first treatment involves adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using TILs immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated from a person's own melanoma tumor. These cells are grown in large numbers in a laboratory and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient's body. TIL therapy following lymphodepletion can result in durable complete response in a variety of setups.

The second treatment, adoptive transfer of genetically altered autologous lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that encode so called T cell receptors (TCRs), into patient's lymphocytes. After that manipulation lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules found on the surface of melanoma cells and kill them.

A cancer vaccine showed modest benefit in late-stage testing in 2009 against melanoma.

BRAF inhibitors
About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the B-Raf gene. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's vemurafenib could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation. In June 2011, a large clinical trial confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.

In August 2011 Vemurafenib received FDA approval for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. In May 2013 the US FDA approved dabrafenib as a single agent treatment for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor trametinib led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median progression-free survival increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months. Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.

In January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of people with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. In June 2018, the FDA approved the combination of a BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and a MEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.

Eventual resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be due to a cell surface protein known as EphA2 which is now being investigated.

Ipilimumab
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference in June 2010, the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment. The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.

Ipilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.

In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful of improving the five year survival rate, though serious adverse side-effects were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.

Surveillance methods
Advances in high resolution ultrasound scanning have enabled surveillance of metastatic burden to the sentinel lymph nodes. The Screening and Surveillance of Ultrasound in Melanoma trial (SUNMEL) is evaluating ultrasound as an alternative to invasive surgical methods.

Oncolytic virotherapy
In some countries oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising branch of virotherapy, where oncolytic viruses are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity and disorganize vasculature. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus type 1–derived oncolytic immunotherapy), was shown to be useful against metastatic melanoma in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months.

28,"The title Viscount Taaffe, of Corren, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628, together with the subsidiary title Baron Ballymote. From 1661 to 1738, the Viscounts Taaffe were also the Earls of Carlingford.

From the 18th century onwards, the holders of these titles mainly lived in the Holy Roman Empire and subsequently in the Austrian Empire, where they also held the title of Graf Taaffe (German: Count Taaffe), the continental equivalent of an Earl.  In 1919, as a consequence of siding with the enemies of Britain in World War I, the viscountcy was one of only three primary titles (together with the royal dukedoms of Albany and Cumberland) to be forfeit under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.  Also in 1919, the family's Holy Roman Empire title was no longer recognised by the new Austrian Republic, along with all other Austrian noble titles.  In any case, with the death of the 12th Viscount's heir in 1967, all these titles, and any claims to them, are now dormant.

History

The Taaffes in the Great Britain & Ireland

From the 13th century, the Taaffes had been one of the leading families in the north of Ireland. Legend suggests that the whole Taaffe family moved from Wales (Britain) to Ireland around 1196; in Britain they lived in the area currently known as Taff Vale. According to official Irish records, in 1320, William Taaffe had his seat at Smarmore Castle. Another branch of the family, which died out in about  1400, was based at Liscarton Castle in County Meath.

In 1628, Sir John Taaffe was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Viscount Taaffe, of Corren, and Baron Ballymote. He left fifteen children, of whom the eldest, Theobald, who succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Taaffe, took a prominent part in the English Civil War and on the Restoration was created Earl of Carlingford. The 1st Earl was succeeded by his second son Nicholas, who had served in the Anglo-Spanish War, as 2nd Earl. He was killed at the 1690 Battle of the Boyne fighting for the former King James II of England against William III of Orange, when his title was attainted and his estates forfeited. Another son Fr. James Taaffe O.F.M., a Franciscan priest and teacher, served as papal nuncio to Ireland, chaplain to the exiled queen mother Henrietta Maria, in Paris.

The Taaffes in continental Europe

The 2nd Earl's younger brother, Francis, studied at the University of Olomouc (Olmütz) in the Imperial Margraviate of Moravia, and served at the court of Emperor Ferdinand III as well as under Duke Charles IV of Lorraine, whose most intimate friend he became. He rose to be a Field Marshal in the Habsburg Army, having greatly distinguished himself at the 1683 Battle of Vienna and in the other Turkish campaigns, and was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He was sent on many important diplomatic missions, and at the end of his life was Chancellor and Chief Minister to the Duke of Lorraine. Despite the Jacobite connections of his family, Francis Taaffe was confirmed as 3rd Earl of Carlingford by King William III, and the attainder and forfeiture of the estates incurred by his elder brother was repealed. This favour he owed to his position at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, William's most important ally in the Grand Alliance.

On the 3rd Earl's death, his titles and estates went to his nephew Theobald, who succeeded as 4th Earl. His father had fallen during the 1689 Siege of Derry, and he had himself served with distinction in the Habsburg Army.

On the 4th Earl's death in 1738, the Earldom of Carlingford became extinct; both the Imperial and Irish estates as well as the viscountcy of Taaffe went to a cousin, Nicholas, who succeeded as 6th Viscount while his Irish estates were claimed under the Act of 1703 by a Protestant heir, leading to a lengthy lawsuit. Like so many of his family, Nicholas Taaffe had been brought up in Lorraine, was Chancellor of Duke Leopold and joined the Habsburg Army; he fought in the Silesian Wars against Prussia. After years of fighting for his Irish estates, the case was ended by a compromise embodied in a private Act of Parliament, by which the estates were sold and one-third of the value given to Nicholas Taaffe. With the money he acquired the castle of Ellischau (Nalžovy) in Bohemia; he had also inherited other property in the Habsburg dominions. He was naturalised in Bohemia, and left on record that the reason for this step was that he did not wish his descendants to be exposed to the temptation of becoming Protestants so as to avoid the operation of the Penal Laws. Nicholas Taaffe had a distinguished career in the Habsburg Army; he eventually rose to the rank of a Field Marshal, and was created Graf von Taaffe (Count of  Taaffe) by Empress Maria Theresa. The Taaffe family thus held titles of nobility from different countries, governed by different rules. While the Irish titles descended according to strict primogeniture, the title of Count was under Austrian and Holy Roman Empire law and applied equally to all male-line descendants of the original grantee in perpetuity; male family members were thus styled Graf, female family members were styled Gräfin.

With the Taaffes now living mainly in the lands of the Habsburgs, a Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords in 1860 recognized the right of the family to hold the Irish title.

Eduard Graf Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe had a distinguished political career in the service of the Habsburgs and served for two terms as Minister-President of Austria under Emperor Francis Joseph I, leading cabinets from 1868 to 1870 and 1879 to 1893. Upon his death in 1895, his peerages passed to Heinrich Graf Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe.

Loss of both titles

In World War I, Heinrich Graf Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe and his family remained loyal to the Austrian monarch. Thus in 1919, the 12th Viscount was deprived of the viscountcy following the enactment of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. Under the provisions of the Act, his heirs and  successors were entitled to petition the British Crown for restoration of the title. However, on the death of his last male-line descendant Richard in 1967 no eligible heirs came forward and the title became extinct.

Independent of the legal situation in Britain, the monarchy was abolished in Austria on 12 November 1918, and on 28 April 1919 the newly established Republic of German-Austria under a coalition of the Social Democratic and Christian Social parties abolished all noble titles for Austrians through the Adelsaufhebungsgesetz, a law which still remains in effect. This meant that Heinrich Graf Taaffe was no longer recognised as such by the Austrian State, although in society circles and private newspapers he still appeared as Count.

29,"Dragon Island is a small privately owned island just outside Harataonga Bay, on the northeast coast of Great Barrier Island, located  to the northeast of Auckland, in New Zealand. The island provides Harataonga Bay with shelter from easterly and southeasterly winds by blocking the bay from Pacific storms. The island is in relatively calm water, sheltered by the larger Rakitu Island to the north. It was once farmed but is now unpopulated and has reverted to scrub.

Dragon Island is also a name sometimes given (quixotically) to a small island in the Mediterranean Sea, a little more than one km wide at its greatest extent, and about 4 km long, located just off the southwestern point of the island of Majorca, approximately 210 km due east of Valencia, Spain. This island comprises the Parc Natural Sa Dragonera. It is the island referred to as Dragon Island in chapter eight of the historical novel Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian.

30,"Punaluu Beach (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between Pāhala and Nāālehu on the Big Island of the U.S. state of Hawaii. The beach has black sand made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
Punaluu is frequented by endangered hawksbill and green turtles, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.

The Beach

The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the ancient Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the Hawaiian language puna luu means ""spring [water] diver for"". 
The beach is located at coordinates . Access is from the Hawaii Belt Road: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punaluu Black Sand Beach Park.

Wahi Pana O Punaluu

e Punaluu is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of Henry Ōpūkahaia (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punaluu. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punaluuu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Kaiei.e. Heiau. Thought to be a fishing shrine, the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na iliili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane. The name Kaiei.e. is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous ieie vine. Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Kaiei.e. today. Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, Yes

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course. Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punaluu Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kaneeleele; Mailekini or Punaluu Nui. This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punaluu Bay. Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906. Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone). Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is Ala Kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Kau coast to Puna. This trail once paved with the na iliili hanau was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punaluu Nui and Kaiei.e. heiau.

Kii pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

Endangered species

Rare and endangered native animals known at Punaluu and Ninole are the honu ea (hawksbill turtle), honu (green turtle), Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pool fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk (io) that nests in the trees at Punaluu. Spinner dolphins and humpback whales can also be sighted offshore from Punaluu. Residents say such sightings are common. A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punaluu in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered hawksbill turtles are located along the Punaluu and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The hawksbill turtle or honu'ea (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean. Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawaii. More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawaii Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened green turtle or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punaluu. Red seaweed, a favorite food of the green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers. Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain  from the turtles at all times.

The endangered Hawaiian hoary bat, opeapea, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punaluu. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet. It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects. Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole. It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honuapo. Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwāa, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honuapo. The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marsh, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwāa Springs.

Vegetation
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and aā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities. In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth). Native plants such as ilima (Sida fallax), naupaka kahakai (Scaevola taccada), and pōhuehue (Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis) were found in the area.

Wetlands

The second largest spring complex on Hawaii Island is located at Punaluu and Ninole Cove. Stretching from Punaluu to Nīnole Springs through Kāwāa to Honupo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna. These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

Anchialine pools
Anchialine pools of various types occur near and around Punaluu and Ninole Cove. These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea. They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves. Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks. The orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation. Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, non-native fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

Koa
Punaluu has long been known for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore. The pristine, spring fed waters of Punaluu mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punaluu still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellowfin tuna (ahi) and mackerel (ono, or wahoo). Historically, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

Development
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by C. Brewer & Co. from 1969 to 1972. A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back. The project was partially built but abandoned. 

In 2005, further development called ""Sea Mountain"" of about  and up to 2000 residential units was proposed by a company based in Beverly Hills, California. An environmental impact statement was developed in 2006. Despite the involvement of Jean-Michel Cousteau, this development met local opposition.

Popular culture
In the 1960s, Japanese actor and guitarist Yūzō Kayama composed a surf rock tune called ""Black Sand Beach"". This song has since been played by Yūzō Kayama & Launchers, Takeshi Terauchi & Blue Jeans, The Ventures, & The Aquatudes.

32,"The 1959 Escuminac disaster (also to referred to as the Escuminac hurricane) was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years. It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane. The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day. Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean, it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. The remnants struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21.

In its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7 million (1959 USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49 ft (15 m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22 fishing boats capsized with their crews, causing 35 fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing damage costing $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.

Early history

On June 15, a tropical wave with associated instability was observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June 16, and the next day developed a weak circulation at the same time that Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming a tropical depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.

As the depression struck western Florida, it produced  above normal tides, which damaged docks and caused beach erosion. Wind gusts near Sarasota reached about 49 mph (80 km/h). After previously wet conditions, the system dropped heavy rainfall across the state, unofficially reaching  in some areas and causing flooding. Along the Indian River, flooding damaged citrus crops, and statewide some roads were damaged due to flooding. When the storm was first forming in the Gulf of Mexico, it spawned an F3 tornado in Miami that lasted for over 20 minutes. The National Climatic Data Center considered it the worst tornado in the city since one in 1925, and the overall path was about . A total of 77 people were injured due to the tornado, mostly due to cuts from broken glass, and damage from it was estimated at $1.5 million. Another tornado was reported north of West Palm Beach, although it affected a sparsely populated area; total damage statewide totaled $1,656,000.

Storm approach to Canada
Late on June 18, it is estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and that day the Miami Hurricane Center issued its last advisory, warning ships of the potential for future strengthening. The storm moved rapidly to the northeast, passing halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina early on June 19. At 0250 UTC that day, a ship reported a falling barometric pressure of  with west-southwesterly winds of . Although it was associated with a diffused frontal zone, the storm maintained a warm core and initially remained largely tropical. At 1200 UTC on June 19, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane about halfway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia, with a pressure of . By six hours later, it became extratropical, although the former hurricane intensified further to peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). On June 20, the storm slowed and turned sharply to the northwest. It weakened slightly before moving ashore near Canso, Nova Scotia. Crossing the island, it struck Prince Edward Island before turning sharply to the east and crossing Nova Scotia again. By late on June 20, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to the east-northeast. The extratropical storm moved over southeastern Newfoundland and dissipated on June 21.

Before the storm reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport provided notices for the advancing storm. On the day of the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

Impact and aftermath

Along the coast of New Brunswick, the storm produced 49 ft (15 m) waves that destroyed several boats, including 22 over open waters between Point Escuminac and Richibucto. Two bodies washed ashore in the latter city, and eleven bodies were eventually discovered. About one-third of the salmon boats in Miramichi were destroyed. Across New Brunswick, the storm disrupted communications near the coast. Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate. The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region, peaking at 75 mph (120 km/h), and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.29 in (109 mm) in Nova Scotia. There, many lobster cages were destroyed, and boats were removed from their moorings. In Prince Edward Island, up to 50% of lobster traps were destroyed or missing, including 5,000 destroyed traps near Souris. As with New Brunswick, several boats were destroyed or washed ashore, and damage in the province was estimated at $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). A total of 35 people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, mostly fishermen. As a result, the Escuminac Disaster, as it came to be known, became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick. The Minister of Fisheries considered the event as ""the worst disaster to hit a Canadian fishing fleet in about 100 years.""

In the days after the storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police operated search and rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24 adults became widows, and 83 children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was on a tour of the country at the time.

In memory of the storm victims, artist Claude Roussel created a wood sculpture entitled ""Les Pêcheurs – The Fishermen"", which won first prize at New Brunswick Museum in 1962. Later, residents near Escuminac raised money to turn the work into a stone monument, which was dedicated on June 19, 1969. It was nearly 7 ft (2.3 m) in height, weighed about 10,000 lbs (5 tonnes), and depicted a group of fishermen working together, with the names of the deceased on a bronze plaque. In 2001, the government of New Brunswick declared the Escuminac Disaster Monument as a provincial historical site.

He was one of the leading molecular biologists who utilized gene cloning and sequencing technology to first decipher the structure of eukaryotic genes and their modes of regulation. His major contributions to science include the identification of RNA polymerase II(B), the identification of transcriptional control elements, the cloning and dissection of nuclear hormone receptors, revealing their structure and showing how they contribute to human physiology. His group was also one of the first to demonstrate, biochemically and electron-microscopically, that the nucleosome is the smallest unit of chromatin (Cell, Vol. 4, 281–300, 1975). He accomplished much of his work in the 1970-90s.

Chambon was elected a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences and to the French Académie des Sciences in 1985, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1987. He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1999 and a second time in 2018. In 2003 he was awarded the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2004 for his work in the field. In 2010, Chambon was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award ""for the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of transcription in animal cells and to the discovery of the nuclear receptor superfamily"". In 2018 he received the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for a second time.

35,"The Tupolev Tu-98 (NATO reporting name Backfin) was a prototype swept wing jet bomber developed by Tupolev for the Soviet Union.

Design and development
The Tu-98 emerged from a program for a fast supersonic bomber to replace the Tupolev Tu-16. It was powered by two Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engines with side-mounted intakes high on the fuselage (above the wingroot). The Tu-98 was built in 1955 and first flown in 1956. It was shown to an American delegation at the Tushino airfield outside Moscow in June 1956, but it subsequently did not enter service, and only the single prototype was completed.

The basic design of the Tu-98 had a great influence on the subsequent prototype of the Tupolev Tu-28 interceptor, officially known as the Tu-128 (NATO codename 'Fiddler').

Development 
The Tu-98 was a supersonic bomber developed by OKB-156, designed as a replacement for the Tu-16. Work on the prototype began on the basis of the Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers on April 12, 1954. The aircraft's chief designer was D. S. Markov.

The aircraft was built in 1955 and took to the air for the first time in 1956. Test flights continued until 1959. The Tu-98 did not pass any of the state tests nor did it enter into production due to numerous, unresolved manufacturing and technological difficulties. The aircraft was later used as a flying, supersonic research laboratory during the development of the Tu-128 interceptor.

The last flight was made on November 21, 1960 when the undercarriage collapsed. The prototype was subsequently written off.

The ""98"" was further developed into a lightweight version of the supersonic bomber called the ""98A"" (Tu-24).

The Tu-98 was shown to a US delegation under General Twining at the Kubinka military airfield near Moscow in June 1956   and presented by Soviet first secretary  Nikita Khrushchev as the latest Soviet bomber development. The US military was impressed and, as no details were given about the aircraft, assigned the design to the Yakovlev design office. There were also speculations about an alleged series production, which was estimated at 15 pieces per year in 1958, which is why NATO gave the code name Backfin and the (fictitious) designation Yak-42. A commissioning was never planned for the Tu-98. The only prototype was flown only for test purposes and at the air parade in Tushino.

The design of the Tu-98 had a major impact on the prototype of the Tupolev Tu-28 interceptor, officially known as the Tu-128. In addition to aerodynamic tests for the Tu-128, the Tu-98 was used for tests with the future Tu-128 RP-7 ""Smersch"" radar, where the glazed bow was replaced by the device, and the ""Kompleks 80"" fire control system. The R-4 air-to-air missiles intended as armament for this type were also tested with the Tu-98. The official name of the machine for it was Tu-98LL for ""letajuschtschaja laboratorija"", flying laboratory. After these tests were completed, the Tu-98 was parked in Zhukovsky for a while before it was scrapped. The Tu-98 also provided information for the construction of the Tu-22.

Construction 

The aircraft is built according to the scheme of a mid wing with a swept wing (the sweep angle on the leading edge is 55 degrees). Two engines AL-7F were installed in the stern, and the car was distinguished by long canals and air intakes shifted upwards. The main landing gear were located in the fuselage, which made the wing “clean”, but sharply reduced the stability of the aircraft “on concrete”. The crew consisted of a pilot - a ship commander, a navigator-operator and a navigator-navigator. All jobs had ejection seats. The front of the aircraft was a single pressurized cabin. Behind the pressurized cabin there was a technical compartment with photographic equipment (AFA-33/75). The fuel system consisted of 4 main and one centering tanks in the fuselage. Wing - two-spar, caisson design.

The control system was performed according to the traditional scheme - with a fixed stabilizer, although for the first time in all control channels, Andrey Nikolayevich agreed to use irreversible hydraulic boosters (his saying is known - “the best booster is the one that stands on the ground”). The front desk had a two-wheel axle, the main ones had two pairs of wheels.

For the first time in the domestic bomber, the remote-controlled aft rifle installation DK-18 with two guns was used AM-23. The weapon was aimed at the ARS-1 “Argon” radar sight, the antenna unit of which was placed in the upper part of the keel. The AM-23 cannon was mounted in the forward part on the right, from which the pilot could fire.

Rocket-bomb armament aircraft provided suspension FAB-100, FAB-250 or FAB-500 in various combinations, as well as up to 300  ARS-85, or 61 TRS-132, or 18 TRS-212. For naval aviation, it was supposed to arm the aircraft with AMD-500 and AMD-100 mines, torpedoes RAT-52, MAN, MAV and TAN-53. As the sighting equipment on the plane set radar ""Initiative"" and collimator sights OPB-16.

37,"Caveira is the smallest freguesia (""civil parish"") by area on the island of Flores, located within the municipality (concelho) of Santa Cruz das Flores, in the Azorean archipelago (Portugal). The population in 2011 was 77, in an area of 3.28 km². It is located 5 kilometers south of Santa Cruz das Flores, the municipal seat, in an area primarily concentrating on agriculture.

History
The first colonists were a group of Flemish settlers captained by Willem van der Haegen, who selected the valley of  Ribeira da Cruz for his settlement.  They arrived at the end 15th century with the hope of finding precious metals (tin and silver, specifically), in the belief that Flores was part of the mythical Ihas Cassitérides (). They made their homes in the small grottoes along the river-valley, but when they realized that there were no deposits, they abandoned their settlement and moved to the area of Topo, on the island of São Jorge.  The area remained uninhabited for many decades until the 16th century, as Father Gaspar Frutuoso noted is his historical tome Saudades da Terra and where he mentioned the community but omitted whether it was populated.  The first reference to a populated settlement in Caveira appeared in the works of António Cordeiro, published in 1717, citing the existence of a small place along the coast.

From here Caveira evolved, becoming a primitive community dependent on the much larger administrative and religious village of Santa Cruz (whose parish included Caveira). Owing to the distance and difficulty in traveling from the valley of Ribeira da Cruz, in 1757, the parish vicar (Father Agostinho Pereira de Lacerda) requested that the bishop of Angra (at that time Brother Valério do Sacramento) annex Caveira to the neighboring parish of São Caetano da Lomba (even though it was part of the neighboring municipality). The situation did not improve communication or the betterment of the faith community connected to Lomba, and with the assistance of a local property-holder (José António de Sousa Bettencourt of Graciosa), a small chapel was constructed on the current site of the local cemetery. The chapel to the invocation of Benditas Almas (Blessed Souls), was 12 metres in length and 4.2 meters in width.  Once completed, the parish priest José Joaquim de Almeida quickly petitioned that Caveira should be elevated to parish, going as far as a petition directly to King John VI of Portugal (dated December 19, 1823).  The church remained the property of João António Bettencourt (a descendant) who maintained the building in a reasonable condition, but its condition degraded considerably.  In a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta (in 1867), António José Vieira Santa Rita reported the lamentable condition of the sanctuary.  The cornerstone of the new church was laid on June 13, 1870, but its completion was slow and difficult.  Although supported by emigres to the United States and notable local residents, such as the Visconde da Silva Figueira, the main chapel wasn't completed until September 11, 1880.  From this time the new church was named for Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although the Church in Angra refused to accept the change.

In the beginning of the 20th century, rich in dairy resources, a local man (José Luís) began a local butter-producing business focused on the local Caveirense market.  As the local population slowly shrank, the business was eventually integrated into the União das Cooperatives.

Legend of Caveira
 
During the 16th century, during the Age of Exploration, caravels frequently passed along Flores, on their voyages between Europe and the Americas. These ships were regularly buffeted by Atlantic storms and shipwrecked along the coast. It is said that a survivor of one of these storms, hungry, wet and cold, appeared along a windy and rugged part of the north-east coast, where he was given food, dry clothes and cared for by the local residents. The man, Demétrio, began to enjoy his life in the small village, married and remained there, where he became a popular with its residents. Although a good Christian man, he had many ideas that were considered heretical: for example, he exclaimed that prayers for the dead had no meaning and he negated the existence of Purgatory or Hell. Finally, although he believed in a soul, he believed that it resided in the blood, and that upon a human's death it separated from the body and transformed into a bird, until the body was cremated or degenerated into the soil. He also believed that the bird was the incarnation of Morana, the god of death, and that it sang while the body died, facilitating the soul's entrance into heaven.

While his neighbours did not accept his ideas, he continued to live, educating his sons, and living in harmony with the residents of the village. After a few years, Demétrio, now an old man, after many years in bed with illness, died. At that moment a wagtail flew onto a faia tree close-by, but did not begin to sing as was expected. Demétrio was buried on top of a mountain, and his wife, influenced by her husband's faith, was a little preoccupied with the fact that the bird did not sing. After some time afterword there started to appear a skull (Portuguese: caveira) with an inner light, and the local residents believed that it was Demétrio's soul trying to obtain prayers in order to be delivered from Purgatory. Someone then decided to begin services and pray the rosary for God's intercession on behalf of the good, but heretical, Demétrio. After a short time, the bird began to sing and the skull stopped appearing. At the top of the rugged rock the family constructed a niche, with a panel representing the skull, but the name of the village began to referred to as Caveira.

Geography

Physical geography
The small parish is located along a promontory divided by a couple of river-valleys:  Ribeira da Cruz, in the north, which bisects the hamlet, and Ribeira da Silva, in the south, which separates the civil parish from Lomba, in the municipality of Lajes das Flores. In addition, the Ribeira do Moirato bisects the southern portion of the parish and joins the Ribeira da Silva to empty into the ocean along Fajã Pedro Vieira.  The Caveira promontory is encircled by basaltic fractures and dominated by Ponta da Caveira, an area formed from large polychromatic basalts formations where the community is situated. The northern Ribeira da Cruz is an open escarpment and valley that extends towards the center of the island.  Near the mouth of the Ribeira da Cruz is the large cliffs of Rocha Fernão Jorge, a semi-triangular physical feature formed from basaltic prisms originating from lava flows.  It is a unique feature, similarly found in Antsiranana Bay, northern Madagascar.

Along the coast is the Gruta dos Encharéus, a large cavern/fracture at the base of Ponta da Caveira (50 meters width, 25 meters long and 15 meters in depth) where boats may penetrate and dock.  It was once used as a hideout for pirates, privateers and smugglers in the past, but is currently a tourist site.

Climate
The higher altitudes makes the  parish susceptible to strong ocean winds. Heavy precipitation in this zone allows agriculture to thrive, and in particular the raising of  dairy cattle.

Human geography
The catholic faith community is guided by Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although officially still holding onto the primitive Benditas Almas canonical titles. Its relative proximity to Santa Cruz has allowed the growth of secondary industries associated with activities in the municipal center. The parish also contains the locality Espigão.

Economy
The community is focused on agricultural production, and in particular dairy activities.  As mentioned, João Luís, was the principal investor in the local butter industry in Caveira.  In other communities on Flores, other businessmen concentrated on the single-market butter business; for example, Ponta Ruiva and Ponta Delgada had their own butter factories serving their own markets.  These smaller communities did not participate in the Florense agricultural syndicate pioneered by José Furtado Mota at the time.  This created tensions between consumers and producers, who remarked in a 1918 Açoreano Oriental article that residents of Santa Cruz were never supplied butter, even as 10,000 kilograms of butter were being exported.  Local residents of this community were required to travel to any of the outlying communities in order to purchase butter, including Caveira.  The gradual de-population of this community spelled the extinction of the private butter industry, as the União das Cooperatives swallowed-up smaller businesses.

Religious
 Church of Benditas Almas (), around 1767 the first small church, was constructed under the initiative of José António de Sousa Bettencourt (dedicated to the Blessed Souls) on the site of today's cemetery, but the current church (of the same invocation) was only founded in 1867;

38,"The Commander was a Norton motorcycle with a Wankel rotary engine.

The first Norton Wankel motorcycle was the 1987 Classic using an air-cooled engine, built as a special edition of just 100 machines. It was followed by the air-cooled Interpol 2 model.

The Commander was a liquid-cooled successor to the Interpol 2, liquid cooling being adopted for greater power and reliability. The Commander's final-drive chain was protected by a full enclosure. Some cycle parts (such as wheels, forks, switchgear, clocks & brakes) were bought-in Yamaha items from the XJ900.

Two types of Commander were built. The P52 was a single-seat model equipped for police use. The second was the dual-seat P53 civilian tourer. Both the P52 and P53 had panniers integral with their fibreglass bodywork. The P53 bodywork was later revised to have detachable  K2 panniers.

40,"Since the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) songs have played a large part in spreading the message of the One Big Union. The songs are preserved in the Little Red Songbook.

Definition
The Little Red Songbook (1909), also known as I.W.W. Songs or Songs of the Industrial Workers of the World, subtitled (in some editions) Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent, is a compilation of tunes, hymns, and songs used by the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) to help build morale, promote solidarity, and lift the spirits of the working-class during the Labor Movement.

History
The Little Red Songbook was first published by a committee of Spokane, Washington IWW members in 1909. It was originally called Songs of the Workers, on the Road, in the Jungles, and in the Shops—Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent. It includes songs written by Joe Hill, Ralph Chaplin, T-Bone Slim, and others. The early editions contain many of the most well-known labor songs, such as ""The Red Flag,"" ""The Internationale,"" ""The Preacher and the Slave,"" and ""Solidarity Forever."" Thirty-six editions were published between 1909 and 1995.

A Canadian I.W.W. Songbook, compiled and edited by Jerzy (George) Dymny, featuring 41 songs with a Canadian slant, was published in 1990.

An edition commemorating the centennial of the IWW's founding in 1905 was published in 2005. The latest edition of the Little Red Songbook was printed in 2010.

The 190 different songs included in the Little Red Songbook between 1909 and 1973 are collected and annotated in The Big Red Songbook, edited by Archie Green, David Roediger, and Franklin Rosemont and published in 2007.

42,"Augusten Xon Burroughs (born Christopher Richter Robison, October 23, 1965) is an American writer known for his New York Times bestselling memoir Running with Scissors (2002).

Early life 
Christopher Richter Robison was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the younger of two sons of poet Margaret Robison and John G. Robison, former head of the philosophy department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

He is eight years younger than his brother, fellow memoirist John Elder Robison. He was raised in various towns in Massachusetts, including Shutesbury, Amherst, and Northampton. His older brother had already escaped the unstable home before their parents divorced on July 29, 1978. His mother then sent the 12-year-old Christopher to live with the family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Rodolph Harvey Turcotte, whose ever-changing collection of children, adopted children and patients lived in a large ramshackle property in Northampton.

Robison's mother assigned legal guardianship to Turcotte, who believed that children became adults at 13. A few months after Robison moved in, Turcotte allowed him to drop out of sixth grade.

Education and writing career
Robison obtained a GED at age 17.  At age 18, living on his own in Boston, he legally changed his name to Augusten Xon Burroughs. He later enrolled at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts, as a pre-med student, dropping out before the end of the first semester. He decided to settle in New York City and worked for a Manhattan-based advertising company. In 1996, he sought treatment for alcoholism at a rehabilitation center in Minnesota before returning to Manhattan.

Some of Burroughs' childhood experiences were chronicled in his successful first memoir, Running with Scissors (2002), which was later made into a film by the same name.

In addition to Scissors, Burroughs penned a second memoir, Dry (2003), about his experience during and after treatment for alcoholism. It was followed by two collections of memoir essays, Magical Thinking (2003) and Possible Side Effects (2006). His first novel, Sellevision, was published in 2000.

Burroughs' writing focuses on subjects such as advertising, psychiatrists, religious families, and home shopping networks. It has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, House & Garden, BlackBook, New York, The Times, Bark, Attitude, and Out. Burroughs writes a monthly column for Details. Early in his career, he was a regular commentator on National Public Radio's Morning Edition.

In 2005, Universal Studios and Red Wagon Productions bought the rights to a film based on a then-unreleased memoir about Burroughs' relationship with his father. The book, called A Wolf at the Table, was released on April 29, 2008.

In October 2009, Burroughs released You Better Not Cry: Stories for Christmas, a book of short Christmas stories based on true events that occurred during his childhood.

In 2012, Burroughs released This Is How, a book of advice and memoirs.

Burroughs released his latest book, Toil & Trouble: A Memoir, in October 2019. The work details his experience coming out as ""a witch"" and moving from his apartment in New York City into a mansion in Connecticut with his husband.

Burroughs' books are published by St. Martin's Press and Picador.

Personal life
In a January 2005 interview, reflecting on his life with his then partner, graphic designer Dennis Pilsits, Burroughs said paying tax should allow same-sex couples full legal entitlements:

That's what gay people need to be allowed to do – get married. Not have domestic partnerships; that's not acceptable. I don't believe for a moment [gay marriage] would destroy the sanctity of marriage. But let's just say for a moment that it does. Well, then the sanctity of marriage just has to be destroyed. It's just too bad. You can't have one set of benefits and only give them to some of the people.

Burroughs divides time between New York City and Amherst, Massachusetts. On April 1, 2013, Burroughs married his longtime agent and companion Christopher Schelling at the Staten Island Borough Hall of New York City.

Burroughs has been profiled in People, The Guardian, and Entertainment Weekly, where he ranked 15 on the 2005 list of ""The 25 Funniest People in America"" and was named to the magazine's ""It List"".

Burroughs was presented with a special Trustee Award at the Lambda Literary Awards in 2013.

Lawsuit over Running with Scissors
The family of Dr. Turcotte (who died in 2000), Burroughs' legal guardian when he was a child, were concerned about the depiction of the Finch family in Running with Scissors. In August 2007, Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, settled with the Turcotte family, who stated that their presentation as the Finch family was largely fictional and written in a sensational manner. The Turcottes originally sought damages of $2 million for invasion of privacy, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Burroughs defended his work as ""entirely accurate,"" but agreed to call the work a ""book"" (instead of ""memoir"") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for ""any unintentional harm"" to the Turcotte family.

In August 2007, when the suit was settled, Burroughs stated:

I consider this not only a personal victory but a victory for all memoirists. I still maintain that the book is an entirely accurate memoir, and that it was not fictionalized or sensationalized in any way. I did not embellish or invent elements. We had a very strong case because I had the truth on my side.

In October 2007, Burroughs further stated that he felt vindicated by the settlement:

I'm not at all sorry that I wrote it. And you know, the suit settled – it settled in my favor. I didn't change a word of the memoir, not one word of it. It's still a memoir, it's marketed as a memoir, [the Turcottes] agreed one hundred percent that it is a memoir.

Film and television 
Running with Scissors was made into a film in 2006. It was directed by Ryan Murphy, produced by Brad Pitt, and starred Joseph Cross, Brian Cox, Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Evan Rachel Wood. Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role.

44,"Rockefeller State Park Preserve is a state park in Mount Pleasant, New York in the eastern foothills of the Hudson River in Westchester County. Common activities in the park include horse-riding, walking, jogging, running, bird-watching, and fishing. The park has a rich history and was donated to the State of New York over time by the Rockefeller Family beginning in 1983. A section of the park, the Rockwood Hall property, fronts the Hudson River. It was formerly the private residence of William Rockefeller, and began use as a New York state park in the early 1970s. In 2018, the park was added to New York's State Register of Historic Places.

Features
Rockefeller State Park Preserve is designated by the National Audubon Society as an Important Bird Area with over 180 species, and is known for its wildlife, carriage trails, and scenic vistas. The park's  of carriage roads allow visitors to view the various habitats of the  park, which include open meadows, dense forest, meandering brooks, wetlands, and the  Swan Lake.

Rockefeller State Park Preserve abuts the Old Croton Aqueduct State Historic Park and Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. The preserve also abuts extensive private land owned by the Rockefeller family which is open to the public. The trails in the private area, still in use by the Rockefeller family and also open to the public, connect with those in the state park.  Many of these trails were planned and laid out by John D. Rockefeller (Sr.) and his descendants. Access to these trails, and additional access to the state park trails, is available from Sleepy Hollow Road and Bedford Road/Route 448 in Sleepy Hollow. A section of the State Park is west of the Preserve, along the Hudson River, and is called the Rockwood Hall section.

The Visitor Center in the Preserve also has a small art gallery that frequently displays paintings and photographic art works of local artists.

Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture, ""a nonprofit farm and educational center designed to demonstrate, teach and promote sustainable, community-based food production,"" is located within walking distance of the preserve. The pigs from Stone Barns often forage in the woods of the preserve. Cattle also graze the preserve's land.

Raven Rock, a large outcrop in the southeaster corner of the Preserve, is mentioned in Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow as being ""[haunted by a woman in white who] was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow"".

The park is open year-round, from sunrise to sunset, with office hours from 9a.m. to 4:30p.m. There is a $6.00 fee for parking.

Rockwood Hall

Rockwood Hall, a section of the state park, was formerly the site of the home of William Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller. Laurence Rockefeller donated the land to New York in 1999 for use as a park. One of the early owners of the property was Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, who lived there from 1840 to 1848. Edwin Bartlett obtained the property and build Rockwood, an English Gothic castle of locally quarried stone. Bartlett sold the house to his business partner William Henry Aspinwall in 1860; Aspinwall made it his summer home and improved the property and house, and purchased enough land to make his estate . Upon his death in 1875, his son Lloyd Aspinwall lived there until 1886. William Rockefeller then purchased it for $150,000. Rockefeller expanded his property to about  and either renovated or rebuilt the castle. The resulting 204-room house measured 174 x 104 feet and was the second-largest private house in the U.S. at the time, only behind the Biltmore mansion in Asheville, North Carolina.  After sitting vacant for a time, the mansion was torn down in the 1940s.

In 1971 Representative Otis Pike proposed a bill to expropriate historic Gardiners Island, owned by the Gardiner family since 1639, to turn it into a Federal National Monument.  Robert David Lion Gardiner, one of the co-owners, complained that the proposal to expropriate his family's property  was unfair, when the Rockefeller's had been allowed to continue to own the Pocantico Hills.

The land has been used as part of the park since the 1970s, when Laurence Rockefeller leased the estate to New York for use as a park.

In popular culture
The park's entrance on New York State Route 117 and the highway itself were used briefly in the 2002 comedy, Super Troopers.

45,"John Forrest Dillon (December 25, 1831 – May 6, 1914) was an attorney in Iowa and New York, a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court and a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit. He authored a highly influential treatise on the power of states over municipal governments.

Education and career

Born on December 25, 1831, in Northampton, (then part of Montgomery County, now part of Fulton County), New York, Dillon received a Doctor of Medicine in 1850 from the University of Iowa. He read law in 1852. He entered private practice in Davenport, Iowa from 1852 to 1853. He was county attorney for Scott County, Iowa from 1853 to 1858. He was a Judge of the Iowa District Court for the Seventh Judicial District from 1858 to 1862. He was a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court from 1862 to 1868.

Federal judicial service

Dillon was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 9, 1869, to the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 16 Stat. 44. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 22, 1869, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on September 1, 1879, due to his resignation.

Scholarship and notable ruling

While on the federal bench, Dillon wrote Municipal Corporations (1872), one of the earliest systematic studies of the subject. He also authored Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts and Municipal Bonds, both in 1876. On February 17, 1876, during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court.

Later career

Following his resignation from the federal bench, Dillon was a Professor of law for Columbia University from 1879 to 1882. He resumed private practice in New York City, New York from 1882 to 1914. He was the Storrs Professor of law at Yale University from 1891 to 1892, during which time he wrote The Laws and Jurisprudence of England and America: Being a Series of Lectures Delivered Before Yale University. He died on May 6, 1914, in New York City.

Memorial

A memorial fountain to Dillon was erected in downtown Davenport in 1918, carved of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style, by sculptor Harry Liva.

Family

In 1853, Dillon married Anna Margery Price (born 19 June 1835). They had two sons and a daughter. Anna and their daughter, Mrs. Annie Dillon Oliver, died in the sinking of the French ocean liner SS La Bourgogne in July, 1898.  Dillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855–1918), became a lawyer in Iowa and a Master of Chancery in federal court. John F. Dillon's sister married John B. Jordan, a Davenport merchant. That marriage produced a daughter Jennie, who married Louis Stengel. Louis and Jennie Stengel had a son, Charles Dillon (Casey) Stengel, named after the Judge, who had a long career as a baseball player and manager.

Dillon's Rule

The theory of state preeminence over local governments was expressed as Dillon's Rule in an 1868 case: ""Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. As it creates, so may it destroy. If it may destroy, it may abridge and control"". By contrast, the Cooley Doctrine, or the doctrine of home rule, expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination. In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated, ""local government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away"".

In Municipal Corporations (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that are expressly granted to them. This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as ""Dillon's Rule."" It holds that municipal governments have only the powers expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those powers necessarily implied by the express powers, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning. Further, the powers expressly granted to the municipality should be narrowly construed, and any ambiguities in the legislative grant of power should be resolved against the municipality. However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable.

The Supreme Court of the United States cited Municipal Corporations and fully adopted Dillon's emphasis on state power over municipalities in Hunter v. Pittsburgh, which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the objections of a majority of Allegheny's residents. The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's distinction between public, municipal corporations and private ones. However, the Court did not prevent states from passing legislation or amending their constitutions to explicitly allow home rule. This constitutional allowance was reiterated in Trenton v. New Jersey, where the Supreme Court held that ""In the absence of state constitutional provisions safeguarding it to them, municipalities have no inherent right of self-government which is beyond the legislative control of the state, but are merely departments of the state, with powers and privileges such as the state has seen fit to grant, held and exercised subject to its sovereign will”.

Hundreds of United States court decisions have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights. Critics of the rule have argued that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and undermines democracy or that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures. Some have suggested that Dillon's approach derived from the contemporary view that cities were inherently corrupt political organs. States which do not follow Dillon's Rule—home rule states, including Dillon's own Iowa—remain in the minority, despite the significant decrease in the public perception of municipal corruption.

David Y. Miller argues that Dillon hit upon a central paradox defining American cities: having great political authority while having little legal legitimacy. He quotes Dillon as calling municipalities ""mere tenants at will of their respective state legislatures"" which could be ""eliminated by the legislature with a stroke of the pen"". Dillon also said that eliminating local government would be ""so great a folly, and so great a wrong"".

46,"Matthew Charles Light (born June 23, 1978) is a former American football offensive tackle who spent his entire 11-year career playing for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).  He played college football for Purdue University.  He was picked by the Patriots in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft.

Early years
Light was born in Greenville, Ohio.  He attended Greenville High School, where he played football for the Green Wave as a three-year two-way starter.  On defense, he played linebacker and was a second-team Division II all-state selection at the position, and as a senior earned all-county, all-conference, and all-district honors after making 69 tackles and forcing two fumbles.  On offense, he played guard as a sophomore, tackle as a junior, and tight end as a senior, when he caught four passes for 75 yards and a touchdown.  He also competed in the shot put in track and field, and was a district champion as well as an all-county and all-conference selection.

College career
Light attended Purdue University, where he played for the Purdue Boilermakers football team from 1996 to 1999.  He began his career as a true freshman tight end in 1996, appearing in seven games as a reserve and making one reception for 16 yards. He redshirted the 1997 season after undergoing left shoulder surgery in the spring. In 1998, he moved to left tackle, starting 13 games and earning an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection as part of an offensive line that only allowed 16 sacks of future Super Bowl MVP quarterback Drew Brees. In 1999, Light started 12 games for an offensive line that allowed just 15 sacks, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. In the 2000 season, Light earned first-team All-Big Ten recognition after starting 12 games at left tackle, helping an offensive line that gave up only seven sacks en route to a Big Ten title and Rose Bowl Game appearance.

Professional career

New England Patriots
Light was drafted in the second round (48th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He started 12 of 14 games played during his rookie season in 2001, helping a Patriots running game which averaged 112.2 yards per game. He was the starting left tackle for an offensive line that led the way for 133 yards on 25 carries (5.3 yard average) in the Patriots 20–17 victory in Super Bowl XXXVI over the St. Louis Rams. He was named to the Football News 2001 NFL All-Rookie Team following the season. Light returned in 2002 to start all 16 games at left tackle for the Patriots, who missed the playoffs.

In 2003, Light again started 16 games, and earned his second Super Bowl ring after helping to not allow a sack against a Carolina Panthers defensive line in Super Bowl XXXVIII that featured Kris Jenkins, Mike Rucker, Brentson Buckner and Julius Peppers. Light was a part of an offensive line that enjoyed one of the most successful seasons in club history in 2004, starting 16 games at left tackle and helping the team to average more than four yards per carry for the first time in 19 seasons and helping Corey Dillon set a single season franchise record with 1,635 rushing yards. In October 2004, he signed a six-year contract extension with the team worth $27 million. He earned his third Super Bowl ring in a win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX.

Light began the 2005 season just as he did the previous three, starting at left tackle before a broken leg suffered against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 3 kept him inactive for the next 11 games and eventually led to his placement on injured reserve on December 22. He returned in 2006 to start 16 games. His play earned him an appearance in the 2007 Pro Bowl, the first Pro Bowl appearance of his career, where he replaced the injured Jonathan Ogden. 

In 2007, Light started all 16 games and all three playoff games for the Patriots, including their loss to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, when the Patriots offensive line allowed five sacks of quarterback Tom Brady. He was one of eight Patriots players, and one of three Patriots offensive linemen (joining Dan Koppen and Logan Mankins) elected in December 2007 to the 2008 Pro Bowl.

In the 2008 season, started 16 games for the sixth time in his career. After being named to the Patriots 50th anniversary team in August 2009, Light started the first five games of 2009 before missing five games due to an injury. He returned in Week 12 and started the remainder of the season at left tackle. In 2010, Light started all 16 games at left tackle and was named as an injury replacement to the 2010 Pro Bowl.

On July 31, 2011, Matt Light signed a two-year contract with the New England Patriots.

At the end of the 2011 season, Light and the Patriots appeared in Super Bowl XLVI. He started in the game, but the Patriots lost to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.

Retirement/broadcasting career
On May 7, 2012, he officially announced his retirement in a press conference at Gillette Stadium.

On July 19, 2012, it was announced that Light would join ESPN as an NFL analyst. He will contribute to SportsCenter, Sunday NFL Countdown, NFL Live, First Take, and NFL32.

47,"Coricidin, Coricidin 'D' (decongestant), or Coricidin HBP (for high blood pressure), is the name of a drug marketed by Schering-Plough that contains dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant) and chlorpheniramine maleate (an antihistamine). It is now owned by Bayer. Varieties of Coricidin may also contain acetaminophen (an analgesic/antipyretic) and guaifenesin (an expectorant).

Medicinal use
Coricidin is used to alleviate coughs and includes chlorpheniramine for people with high blood pressure. Other versions of Coricidin are used to reduce fever or as an expectorant. Side effects can include diarrhea and hallucination.

Recreational use

Coricidin is sometimes used in high doses as a recreational drug because it contains the dissociative dextromethorphan. In this context, Coricidin is referred to as C's, red devils (red D's), Skittles, trips, or china red.

Use in popular music

In the late 1960s, blues-rock guitarist Duane Allman began using an empty glass Coricidin bottle as a guitar slide, finding it to be just the right size and shape for this purpose. Allman started to play slide guitar when he received two birthday gifts from his brother, Gregg: a copy of Taj Mahal's debut album, with its version of ""Statesboro Blues"", and a bottle of Coricidin pills (as Duane had a cold that day). Other prominent slide guitarists, such as Derek Trucks (a later member of the Allman Brothers Band), Ray Wylie Hubbard, Rory Gallagher, J. D. Simo, and Gary Rossington also adopted the Coricidin bottle as a slide.

49,"Thomas Dwight ""Dike"" Eddleman (December 27, 1922 – August 1, 2001) was an American athlete who was generally considered the greatest athlete in the history of athletics at the University of Illinois.  Eddleman participated on the university's basketball, track and field, and football teams between the years of 1942 and 1949. Eddleman earned a combined 11 varsity letters in his career at the university, during which he also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Eddleman was born in Centralia, Illinois, and attended Centralia High School. On October 24, 2008, Eddleman was named a Distinguished Alumni of Centralia High school. He, along with five others, including James Brady, were the first to be named Distinguished Alumni. His wife, Teddy Eddleman, accepted his award.

Beginning in 1969, Eddleman served the University of Illinois as a fundraiser for the athletic department. In tribute to his years of service to the university's athletics, in 1993, the University of Illinois athlete of the year awards for both men and women were named in his honor. In 2002, the portion of Fourth Street in Champaign, Illinois that runs along the east side of Memorial Stadium between Peabody Drive and Kirby Street was designated Honorary Dike Eddleman Way (a street in his hometown of Centralia, Third Street, which runs past the old high school, is also designated Dike Eddleman Way).

In 1983, Eddleman was inducted into the National Federation of State High School Associations Hall of Fame.

Sports accomplishments

High school
As a high school player, Eddleman is considered one of the finest players in the history of high school basketball in the state of Illinois. Eddleman played four years at Centralia High School, from 1939 to 1942. Eddleman led the Centralia Orphans to the 1942 Illinois state basketball championship, after finishing fourth in 1939 and third in 1941. In the 1942 title game, Eddleman single-handedly led a comeback as the Orphans were 13 points down with five minutes to go. As a junior and senior, Eddleman led the state in scoring with 969 and 834 points, respectively. His 969 points as a junior broke the previous state record of 751 points. During his high school career, Eddleman scored 2702 career points, which was at the time of his graduation from high school a state record for most points in a career. Eddleman was the first high school player in Illinois to average at least 20 points per game. In 2007, the Illinois High School Association named Eddleman one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament.

University of Illinois

Basketball
In the fall of 1942, Eddleman enrolled at the University of Illinois, playing on both the freshman football and basketball teams. However, in January 1943 Eddleman was called to military duty during World War II. He was placed in the Army Air Corps and, after being sent to Fort Sheridan in Chicago for basic training, he was stationed in Miami Beach where he was assigned as a physical trainer for new cadets, all while still being only 20 years of age. It was in Florida that he would suffer the most serious injury of his time in the military as during a beach volleyball game, Eddleman broke his right foot. Following approximately eighteen months in Florida, Eddleman returned to his home state near Belleville, Illinois stationed at Scott Field. His final destination during his military service was Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he played basketball for the Kittyhawks, a military service ""all-star"" team regarded as one of the greatest in the nation. While playing for the Kittyhawks, he was named to the College All-Star team composed of the best college players in the country. The team played games around the country, however, one particularly memorable game was when the Kittyhawks beat the Harlem Globetrotters in 1945. Eddleman would close out his military service in the Fall of 1946, transitioning back to the life of a college student athlete.

Upon returning to the University of Illinois, as a second semester freshman in the spring of 1947, Eddleman was immediately issued his Fighting Illini football and basketball uniforms and then flown to Berkeley, California to play in two basketball games prior to the semester commencing. The Fighting Illini played consecutive games against the University of California Berkeley on December 20 and 21. Eddleman followed that trip with another flight, this time to Pasadena to play on January 1 in the 1947 Rose Bowl game. He and his Illinois football teammates beat the UCLA Bruins by a score of 45–14, meanwhile back in Madison, Eddleman's basketball teammates would lose on the same day to the Wisconsin Badgers, the team that would go on to win the Big Ten title. Eddleman returned by train to Champaign, where he joined the reunited remaining group of ""The Whiz Kids"", Ken Menke, Gene Vance, and Andy Phillip as well as All-American guard Walt Kirk on the basketball team to play in a January 4 game against the University of Mexico in which the Illini would win by a score of 94–36. Eddleman was back for the remainder of a season where he would spend most of it as a backup to ""The Whiz Kids"". The Illini would finish with an overall record of 14–6 and a Big Ten record of 8–4, second place in the conference.

In his second season of varsity basketball, Eddleman would lead the team in scoring and be named to the Associated Press 2nd team All-American, Converse 3rd team All-American, as well as True Magazine 3rd team All-American. The team would be led by new head coach, Harry Combes to an overall record of 15 wins and 5 losses and a 7 and 5 conference record, third place in the Big Ten. After the season, Eddleman would be named First-team All-Big Ten as well as the University of Illinois Athlete of the Year.

In the 1948–49 season, Eddleman would lead the basketball team to the Big Ten title, and an appearance in the NCAA Final Four. That year, he earned the Chicago Tribunes Silver Basketball as the conference MVP. He was named a Converse 1st team All-American, Big Ten Player of the Year and earned the Big Ten Medal of Honor. Eddleman served as the team captain in 1949, and was named the team MVP that year and the University of Illinois Athlete of the Year for the second straight season. In his military shortened tenure at Illinois, Eddleman scored 618 points in 55 games for an average of 11.2 points per game, however, 606 of those points were scored in his final two seasons for an average of 13.5 points per game. The Fighting Illini's record over Eddleman's three season was 50 wins and 15 losses overall and 25 wins and 11 losses in the conference.

Football
Eddleman was a member of three football teams while attending Illinois, however, the 1946 team would be the most successful. Not only would they win the 1947 Rose Bowl game, they were also the Big Ten champions finishing with 8 wins and 2 losses overall while going 6 and 1 in conference play. The 1947 team was not as successful, finishing in fourth place in the conference with a 3 and 3 record, while winning 5 games, losing 3 games and tying 1 overall. Eddleman's final season was in 1948. This team would finish in eighth place in the conference with a record of 2 and 5 and an overall record 3 wins and 6 losses. Individually, Eddleman would set several records for punting and punt returning, seven of which still stand at Illinois.

Eddleman was drafted by the Chicago Bears with the 75th pick in the 1947 NFL Draft and was additionally drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 145th pick in the 1948 AAFC Draft.

Track & field
As a high school athlete, Eddleman won three Illinois state high jump titles.  As a collegian, each year that Eddleman attended Illinois he also competed in track as a high jumper. Eddleman would win various high jump titles while at Illinois, including the Chicago Relays, the Illinois Tech Relays, and the Penn Relays. Additionally, he won three high jump titles in each appearance at the Big Ten Indoor Championships, the Central Collegiate Championships, and the Drake Relays. He also won an NCAA Championship in 1948 as well as Big Ten outdoor high jump titles in 1947 and 1949, the Kansas Relays, the Compton Relays, the Purdue Relays, and the Kansas City Games. During his four years of competition, his Fighting Illini team would win an NCAA championship in 1947.

On July 10, 1948, the summer of his junior year, Eddleman became eligible to participate in the 1948 Summer Olympics by qualifying at a meet held in Dyche Stadium at Northwestern University. After qualifying, Eddleman traveled to London in good company with Illini teammate Bob Richards as well as other Olympic notables including Harrison Dillard, Herb McKenley, Clyde ""Smackover"" Scott, and Bill Porter. After qualifying in their respective events, the two Illinois athletes made a quick trip back to Champaign-Urbana on the train, leaving the next day to join the other American Olympic hopefuls in New York in order to board the SS America with a final destination of England.

The high jump took place on the first day of competition, July 30, 1948, and John Winter, a 23-year-old bank clerk from Perth, cleared a height of  on his first attempt. The remaining four jumpers, including Eddleman, failed three times each to match Winter. For the first time in the Olympics, ties were decided according to fewer misses. The winning height was . The second-, third-, and fourth-place jumpers all cleared . Eddleman was awarded fourth place due to his number of misses.  After the Games, Eddleman competed in an additional track and field meet in Glasgow, Scotland, winning the high jump at a personal-best height of . He then returned to the United States on the RMS Queen Elizabeth, arriving in Centralia by train to a citywide celebration. Less than a week later, he was practicing football in Memorial Stadium.

Professional basketball
After leaving the University of Illinois, Eddleman played professionally for four seasons in the National Basketball Association. His career began after he received offers from the Chicago Stags and the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. He decided to play for the Blackhawks because he preferred to live in Moline, Illinois, with his wife and newborn daughter. In 1950, Eddleman led the Blackhawks in scoring as a rookie. After playing for the Tri-City Blackhawks and the Milwaukee Hawks, he was traded to the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons which resulted in a move to Indiana. While playing for the Pistons, he cultivated a friendship with Fred Schaus, who would later become coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. Eddleman played in the NBA All-Star Game in both 1951 and 1952. Over his NBA career, Eddleman scored 3221 points in 266 games, for a scoring average of 12.1 points per game.

During the off-season of the two years that he played in Indiana, Eddleman utilized his physical education degree by working as the recreational director for Central Soya, Incorporated, a Midwest soybean processing company. Prior to the 1954–55 season, after learning he would be traded to the Baltimore Bullets, a team that dropped out of the NBA and folded after playing 14 games in 1954, Eddleman decided to retire from professional basketball and work full-time for Central Soya. In 1956, Eddleman was transferred to a new plant in Gibson City, Illinois, a town located just 30 miles north of Champaign.

Personal life & death
Eddleman married Teddy Georgia Townsley, his high school sweetheart, on December 25, 1945, as the couple exchanged wedding vows in a Christmas ceremony while Eddleman was home on leave from the Army Air Corps. Their marriage resulted in the birth of four children, three daughters and one son. Diana, Nancy, Kristy, and Tom, all of whom attended the University of Illinois.

In 1969 Eddleman left Central Soya and accepted the executive director of Grants-In-Aid position with the University of Illinois Foundation, a fundraising entity working with Fighting Illini Alumni to provide financial aid for student athletes. In 1990, the Grants-In-Aid program was renamed the Fighting Illini Scholarship Fund. Eddleman retired from his position with the University of Illinois on January 1, 1993.

In 1993, the University of Illinois renamed its male and female Athlete of the Year awards the Dike Eddleman Athlete of the Year.

Eddleman died from a heart ailment at Champaign's Carle Foundation Hospital, on August 1, 2001, at the age of 78.

50,"This article is about the administrative divisions of Lithuania.

Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1251–1569)
In the earliest stages of the formation of the Lithuanian state, the area included several ""lands"" (Lithuanian: plural – žemės, singular – žemė), such as Nalšia, Deltuva and Lietuva (as well as others), each ruled by a regional duke. When King Mindaugas () unified the state, he killed, expelled, or subjugated most of the regional dukes. The lands were either added to the new ruler's domain or granted to members of his family.

As the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into Slavic lands, title to the acquired principalities was given to the Grand Duke's offspring or to others of his relatives. For example, Mindaugas granted Black Ruthenia with its center in Navahrudak to his son Vaišvilkas; Gediminas Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1316 to 1341, sent his brother Fiodor to Kiev. This system had major disadvantages: the principalities remained semi-independent with loose ties to the central government. Rulers of these principalities could operate as powerful rivals to the Grand Duke, a situation that led to frequent power-struggles.

In early-15th century Grand Duke Vytautas the Great () initiated administrative reforms. He replaced regional dukes and princes with trustworthy nobles who depended on the favor of the Grand Duke. This marked the rise of Lithuanian nobility. In 1413 the Lithuanians and the Poles signed the Union of Horodło; Vilnius and Trakai Voivodeships formed in ethnic Lithuanian lands, copying the Polish system. The Eldership of Samogitia had a special semi-autonomous status. Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, administrative features; they slowly became  incorporated into the administration of the Grand Duchy. The Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471, five other voivodeships were set up between 1504 and 1514. The Smolensk Voivodeship, the largest of all, was established in 1508, but was lost to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1514.

Voivodeships (Lithuanian: plural – vaivadijos, singular – vaivadija), ruled by appointed officials – voivodes, were further subdivided into powiats (Lithuanian: plural – pavietai, singular – pavietas).

Major administrative reforms took place in 1564–1566 in preparation for the second Statute of Lithuania of 1566 and the overhaul of the judicial system.
The entire territory of the Grand Duchy, with exception of Samogitia, was divided into 12 voivodeships.

Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1569–1795)

Just before the Union of Lublin (1569), the four voivodeships of (Kiev, Podlaskie, Bracław, and Wołyń) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Polish Crown by direct order of Sigismund II Augustus while the Duchy of Livonia, acquired in 1561, became a condominium (joint domain) of both Lithuania and Poland. This left Lithuania with eight voivodeships and one eldership: 
 

After the Livonian War (1558–1582), Lithuania acquired the vassal state of Duchy of Courland with its capital Jelgava. This administrative division remained without any major changes until the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century.

Russian Empire (1795–1914)

Under the Russian Empire, the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided into governorates (Russian: guberniya, Lithuanian: gubernija) and districts (Russian: uyezd, Lithuanian: apskritis). Such system was introducing in Russia during the reforms of 1775. The first governorates, Vilna Governorate (consisting of eleven districts) and Slonim Governorate, were established after the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Just a year later, on December 12, 1796, they were merged into one governorate, called Lithuania Governorate, with capital in Vilnius. In 1801 Lithuania Governorate was split into Lithuania-Vilna Governorate and Lithuania-Grodno Governorate. Forty years later the word ""Lithuania"" was dropped from the two names and official maps of Europe. The territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania became known as the Northwestern Krai. In 1843 another administrative reform took place, creating Kovno Governorate out of seven western districts of the Vilna Governorate. Vilna Governorate received three additional districts: Vileyka and Dzisna from Minsk Governorate and Lida from Grodno Governorate.

In 1837 Augustów Governorate was established in the territories of the Congress Poland, a state in personal union with Russia. Lithuanian Suvalkija was included into this governorate. After the January Uprising, Augustów Governorate was split into Suwałki Governorate and Łomża Governorate (see Administrative division of Congress Poland). This way most of the present-day territory of Lithuania fell into three governorates (Vilna, Kovno, and Suwałki). Two more governorates included some small Lithuanian territories. In 1819 a narrow coastal strip with Palanga and Šventoji was transferred to the Courland Governorate. This territory was acquired from Latvia after an international arbitration in 1920. Small areas in northernmost Grodno Governorate were given to Lithuania after it ""joined"" the Soviet Union in 1940.

In 1861, after announcing the abolition of serfdom, peasants acquired civil rights, among them a right to self-governmence. To facilitate such a right townships (Russian: volost, Lithuanian: valsčius) and elderates (Russian: mir, Lithuanian: seniūnija) were established. By the end of 1861 there were 1,479 elderates in 181 townships of Vilna Governorate and 1,033 elderates in 153 townships of Kovno Governorate. The elderates would elect an elder (Russian: starosta, Lithuanian: seniūnas) and representatives to a township council (Lithuanian: valsčiaus sueiga). However, these institutions had very little power and were dependent on the local nobles. The power was concentrated in the hands of governors, all of whom were appointed by the tsar.

Interwar (1918–1940)
During the interwar period, Lithuania regained independence. The first law on administrative sub-units was passed on July 1, 1919. It declared that Lithuania was divided into twenty counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys). Several more counties (including Zarasai, Naujieji Švenčionys, Vilnius, Eišiškės, Lida, Ashmyany and Hrodna) were reserved for territories in the Vilnius Region, that Lithuania had claims to, but were under Polish or Russian control. Later on Suwałki county was lost to Poland, but Zarasai (also known as Ežerėnai) county was acquired. Two of the designated counties, Trakai and Sejny, had their proclaimed capitals outside the de facto borders of Lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at Kaišiadorys and Lazdijai. After the Klaipėda Region was acquired in 1923, it was divided into three counties (Klaipėda, Šilutė and Pagėgiai). That way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939. According to a law passed in 1931 eleven first-class cities became independent of county administration and had their own government. In March 1939, after an ultimatum from Hitler, Lithuania lost the Klaipėda Region with its three counties. In October Soviet Union returned one fifth of the Vilnius Region in exchange for Red Army stations in Lithuania. Acquired Vilnius Region was divided into three counties (Vilnius, Eišiškės, and Naujieji Švenčionys). Therefore, at the end of 1939 Lithuania again had twenty three counties. Counties were further subdivided into townships (Lithuanian: singular – valsčius, plural – valsčiai). In 1933 there were 365 townships. The townships were further subdivided into elderates (Lithuanian: seniūnija).

The counties were governed by a county governor (Lithuanian: apskrities viršininkas), appointed by the Minister of Interior. Being almost the only link between the central government and the local population, governors were first responsible for a wide range of duties. They were to collect all property left by the retreating German army, organize local government, recruit local army groups, ensure security and stability in the county, etc. In 1920 they were also entrusted to preside over county police. In 1931, in an effort to centralize the government, county governors also became the chairmen of a three-member county governing body (Lithuanian: apskrities valdyba), an executive institution of a county council. That way power in a county became centralized in the hands of a governor. County councils (Lithuanian: apskrities taryba) were elected by local population for a three-year term. The number of representatives from a township depended upon the number of residents in that township.

These were the counties, their territory and residents according to the 1923 census:

Soviet system (1940–1994)

Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union on June 15, 1940. However, due to ensuring World War II the authorities did not introduce major changes to the administrative divisions, just elderates were renamed to apylinkė. After the second occupation in 1944, the number of counties grew from 26 to 41: eleven counties were added in 1946–47 and four more were introduced in 1949. At the end of 1947 there were 37 counties subdivided into 320 townships that were further subdivided into approximately 2,900 apylinkės.

The entire interwar system was scrapped for the 10th anniversary of the first occupation. The new system matched that of other Soviet Republics. On July 20, 1950 Lithuanian SSR was divided into four regions (Russian: oblast, Lithuanian: sritis). The regions were further subdivided into 87 districts (Russian: raion, Lithuanian: rajonas): Kaunas Region with 23 districts, Klaipėda Region with 16 districts, Šiauliai Region with 24 districts, and Vilnius Region with 24 districts.

The townships were abolished and the districts were further subdivided into apylinkės. In 1984 there were 527 apylinkės in Lithuania. Both regions and districts were named after their capitals. Three exceptions were: Smėliai District had its capital in Ukmergė (also capital of Ukmergė district), Panemunė District – capital Garliava, and Klaipėda District – capital Gargždai. In addition to districts, there were five (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai, and Panevėžys) region-administered cities (Lithuanian: srities pavaldumo miestas). They had similar rights as a district.

The regions were short-lived and on May 28, 1953, they were abolished, leaving the districts as the first-level administrative division. The number of districts was reduced several times, and in 1962 it settled at 44. The region-administered cities were renamed to republic-administered cities (Lithuanian: respublikinio pavaldumo miestas). The number of such cities grew to eleven in 1979. These cities became the city municipalities after the reform in 1994.

Division until dissolution of counties in 2010 (1994–2010)
See: Counties of Lithuania, Municipalities of Lithuania, Elderships.

In 1994, an administrative division of Lithuania into 10 new counties as the first level of administration was created.  However, the structure was modified in 2010 with the abolishment of counties administrations.  (The counties continue to be used for statistical and reporting purposes, however.)  Lithuania is divided into:
10 counties (Lithuanian: plural – apskritys, singular – apskritis), each named after their principal city (see: Counties of Lithuania). These apskritys should not be confused with apskritys that existed in the interwar period.
the counties are subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: plural – savivaldybės, singular – savivaldybė). There are three types of municipalities:
43 district municipalities (Lithuanian: rajono savivaldybė). They roughly correspond to districts (raions) that existed under the Soviet rule. Before 1994 they were known just as districts and still are commonly referred to as districts. The word ""municipality"" was added in effort to diminish the Soviet heritage (there were districts [raions] throughout the Soviet Union);
7 city municipalities (Lithuanian: miesto savivaldybė). They are situated around major or important cities. In common language they are referred to as just cities or as just municipalities (because word ""municipality"" in Lithuanian language is associated more with cities and city rights than with districts);
10 municipalities. They were all established after 1994 and they do not have the word ""district"" associated with them.
municipalities consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: plural – seniūnijos, singular – seniūnija).
Each municipality's government is elected in democratic elections of municipality councils. Initially, the elections took place every three years; constitutional amendments in 2002 extended the tenure to four years. The municipality mayors are elected by municipality councils. Also, municipality councils appoint elders to be in charge of an eldership. Currently it is proposed that both mayors and elders should be elected in direct elections.

Counties were ruled by apskrities viršininkas (officially translated as ""governor"") who was appointed by the central government in Vilnius. Their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws of Lithuania and the constitution. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties were too many for Lithuania (the smallest county had only four municipalities).  There were proposals to replace the counties with four or five lands, a new administrative unit, based on the ethnographic regions of Lithuania and centered on the country's five major cities.

On 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished, and the municipalities became the first level of administration.

51,"Protamine sulfate is a medication that is used to reverse the effects of heparin. It is specifically used in heparin overdose, in low molecular weight heparin overdose, and to reverse the effects of heparin during delivery and heart surgery. It is given by  injection into a vein. The onset of effects is typically within five minutes.

Common side effects include low blood pressure, slow heart rate, allergic reactions, and vomiting. Allergic reactions may be severe and include anaphylaxis. The risk is greater in males who have had a vasectomy. While there is no evidence of harm from using during pregnancy it has not been well studied in this group. Protamine works by binding with heparin.

Protamine sulfate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.  It was originally made from the sperm of salmon (salmine, salmon protamine). It is now mainly made using recombinant biotechnology.

Medical uses
Protamine sulfate is usually administered to reverse the large dose of heparin administered during certain surgeries, especially heart surgery where anti-coagulation is necessary to prevent clot formation within the cardiopulmonary bypass pump apparatus. A dose of protamine is given, by drip administered over several minutes, once the patient is off-pump, when extracorporeal circulation and anticoagulation are no longer needed.

It is also used in gene transfer, protein purification and in tissue cultures as a crosslinker for viral transduction. In gene therapy, protamine sulfate has been studied as a means to increase transduction rates by both viral and nonviral-mediated delivery mechanisms (e.g. utilizing cationic liposomes).

Protamine is used in insulin aspart protamine and NPH insulin.

Dosage
Dosage for heparin reversal is 0.5mg to 1.0 mg  mg protamine sulfate IV for every 100 IU of active heparin. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) should be monitored at 5 to 15 minutes after dose then in 2–8 hours afterward.

Adverse effects
Protamine has been reported to cause allergic reactions in patients who are allergic to fish, diabetics using insulin preparations containing protamine, and vasectomized or infertile men. These occur at rates ranging from 0.28% to 6%.

Avoiding rapid infusion of protamine sulfate and pre-treating at-risk patients with histamine receptor antagonists (H1 and H2) and steroids may minimize these reactions. A 5 to 10 mg test dose is recommended following pretreatment before administering the full dose.

Mechanism
It is a highly cationic peptide that binds to either heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to form a stable ion pair, which does not have anticoagulant activity. The ionic complex is then removed and broken down by the reticuloendothelial system. In large doses, protamine sulfate may also have an independent — however weak — anticoagulant effect.

History
Protamine sulfate replaced hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene), another cationic agent that was the original heparin reversal agent in the early days of heart surgery, until studies in the 1960s suggested that hexadimethrine bromide might cause kidney failure when used in doses in excess of its therapeutic range.

52,"Gottfried ""Götz"" von Berlichingen (1480 – 23 July 1562), also known as Götz of the Iron Hand, was a German (Franconian) Imperial Knight (Reichsritter), mercenary, and poet. He was born around 1480 into the noble family of Berlichingen in modern-day Baden-Württemberg. Götz bought Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern) in 1517, and lived there until his death in 1562.

He was active in numerous military campaigns during a period of 47 years from 1498 to 1544, including the German Peasants' War, besides numerous feuds; in his autobiography he estimates that he fought 15 feuds in his own name, besides many cases where he lent assistance to his friends, including feuds against the cities of Cologne, Ulm, Augsburg and the Swabian League, as well as the bishop of Bamberg.

His name became famous as a euphemism for a vulgar expression (Er kann mich am Arsch lecken – ""He can lick my ass"") attributed to him by writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), who wrote a play based on his life.

Life

In 1497, Berlichingen entered the service of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. In 1498, he fought in the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, seeing action in Burgundy, Lorraine, and the Brabant, and in the Swabian War the following year. By 1500, Berlichingen had left the service of Frederick of Brandenburg, and formed a company of mercenaries, selling his services to various Dukes, Margraves, and Barons.

In 1504, Berlichingen and his mercenary army fought for Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria. During the siege of the city of Landshut, he lost his right arm at the wrist when enemy cannon fire forced his sword against him. He had two mechanical prosthetic iron replacements made. The first iron hand was a more simple device, claimed to have been made by a local blacksmith and a saddle maker. The second, more famous prosthetic hand was capable of holding objects from a shield or reins to a quill. Both are on display today at the . In spite of this injury, Berlichingen continued his military activities. In the subsequent years he was involved in numerous feuds, both of his own and in support of friends and employers.

In 1512, near the town of Forchheim, due to a long running and bitter feud with Nuremberg he raided a group of Nuremberg merchants returning from the great fair at Leipzig. On hearing this, Emperor Maximilian placed Berlichingen under an Imperial ban. He was only released from this in 1514, when he paid the large sum of 14,000 gulden. In 1516, in a feud with the Principality of Mainz and its Prince-Archbishop, Berlichingen and his company mounted a raid into Hesse, capturing Philip IV, Count of Waldeck, in the process. A ransom of 8,400 gulden was paid for the safe return of the count. For this action, he was again placed under an Imperial ban in 1518.

In 1519, he signed up in the service of Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, who was at war with the Swabian League. He fought in the defence of Möckmühl, but eventually was forced to surrender the town, owing to a lack of supplies and ammunition. In violation of the terms of surrender, he was held prisoner and handed over to the citizens of Heilbronn, a town he had raided several times. His fellow knights Georg von Frundsberg and Franz von Sickingen successfully argued for his release in 1522, but only after he paid a ransom of 2,000 gulden and swore not to take vengeance on the League.

In 1525, with the outbreak of the German Peasants' War, Berlichingen led the rebel army in the district of Odenwald against the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite this, he was (according to his own account) not a fervent supporter of their cause. He agreed to lead the rebels partly because he had no other option, and partly in an effort to curb the excesses of the rebellion. Despite his wishes to stop wanton violence, Berlichingen found himself powerless to control the rebels and after a month of nominal leadership he deserted his command and returned to the Burg Jagsthausen to sit out the rest of the rebellion in his castle.

After the Imperial victory, he was called before the Diet of Speyer to account for his actions. On 17 October 1526, he was acquitted by the Imperial chamber. Despite this, in November 1528 he was lured to Augsburg by the Swabian League, who were eager to settle old scores. After reaching Augsburg under promise of safe passage, and while preparing to clear himself of the old charges against him made by the league, he was seized and made prisoner until 1530 when he was liberated, but only after repeating his oath of 1522 and agreeing to return to his Burg Hornberg and remain in that area.

Berlichingen agreed to this, and remained near the Hornberg until Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, released him from his oath in 1540. He served under Charles in the 1542 campaign against the Ottoman Empire of Suleyman the Magnificent in Hungary, and in 1544 in the Imperial invasion of France under Francis I of France. After the French campaign, Berlichingen returned to the Hornberg and lived out the rest of his life in relative peace. He died on 23 July 1562 in Hornberg Castle at the age of 81 or 82. Berlichingen married twice and left three daughters and seven sons to carry on his family name.

Legacy
Götz left an autobiography in manuscript form (Rossacher Handschrift). The text was published in 1731 as Lebens-Beschreibung des Herrn Gözens von Berlichingen (""Biography of Sir Götz von Berlichingen""), and republished in 1843 as Ritterliche Thaten Götz von Berlichingen's mit der eisernen Hand (""Knightly Deeds of Götz von Berlichingen with the Iron Hand"") (ed. M. A. Gessert). A scholarly edition of the manuscript text was published in 1981 by Helgard Ulmschneider as Mein Fehd und Handlungen  (""My Feuds and Actions"").

When invited to surrender by the Swabian League, Götz reportedly said of the Swabian general: ""He can lick my ass!"" This anecdote helped popularise the phrase, which came to be called the Swabian salute in his honour. 

Goethe in 1773 published the play Götz von Berlichingen based on the 1731 edition of the autobiography.

Jean-Paul Sartre's play Le Diable et le Bon Dieu features Götz as an existentialist character.

The Waffen-SS 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen in World War II was named after him.

The  and  each bore the emblem of a ""War Glove"" with the legend ""Götz von Berlichingen!,"" while an emblem used by the U-69 pictured signal flags spelling out ""L.M.A.""  – an initialism of the famed vulgar quote.

From commissioning in June 1958 until decommissioning in June 2006, the 2nd Fast Patrol Boat Squadron (2. Schnellbootgeschwader) of the German Navy used the clenched 'Iron Fist' of Götz von Berlichingen in the center of their squadron crest.

During World War II, one of the armed merchant cruisers sent by the Kriegsmarine to Japan was named Götz von Berlichingen by its captain after Kriegsmarine HQ rejected his initial suggestion Michael. The swap may refer to Berlichingen's famous imprecation: Er kann mich im Arsche lecken (""he can lick me in the arse"").

The protagonist of Kentaro Miura's manga series Berserk Guts is somewhat similar to Götz von Berlichingen.

53,"The Chronicon (Chronicle) or Temporum liber (Book of Times) was a universal chronicle written by Jerome. It was one of his earliest attempts at history. It was composed c. 380 in Constantinople; this is a translation into Latin of the chronological tables which compose the second part of the Chronicon of Eusebius, with a supplement covering the period from 325 to 379. Despite numerous errors taken from Eusebius, and some of his own, Jerome produced a valuable work of universal history, if only for the example which it gave to such later chroniclers as Prosper of Aquitaine, Cassiodorus, and Victor of Tunnuna to continue his annals. In conformity with the Chronicon of Eusebius (early 4th century), Jerome dated Creation to 5201 BC.

The Chronicle includes a chronology of the events of Greek mythology, based on the work of Hellenistic scholars such as Apollodorus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eusebius. While the earlier parts are obviously unhistorical, there may be scattered remnants of historical events of late Mycenean Greece from entries of the 12th century BC. (See the historicity of the Iliad. Notably, Jerome's date for the capture of Troy of 1183 BC corresponds remarkably well with the destruction layer of Troy VIIa, the main candidate for the historical inspiration of legendary Troy, dated to c. 1190 BC.) Homer himself is dated to 940 BC, while modern scholarship usually dates him after 800 BC.

54,"Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart (May 27, 1948 – May 13, 2014), born as Diana Moore, subsequently known as Morning Glory Ferns, Morning Glory Zell and briefly Morning G'Zell, was an American community leader, author, and lecturer in Neopaganism, as well as a priestess of the Church of All Worlds. An advocate of polyamory, she is credited with coining the word. With her husband Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, she designed deity images.

Early life
Diana Moore was born in 1948 in Long Beach, California, May 27, 1948. She was raised an only child in a strict Christian household by her Pentecostal mother, though she switched from attending a Methodist church to a Pentecostal one around age 10–12. At age 14, she broke with Christianity after arguing with her Methodist minister grandfather that animals had souls and went to heaven. She was strongly influenced by the Sybil Leek book, Diary of a Witch, which she read during high school. At the age of 17, Diana began practicing witchcraft. At the age of 20, she changed her name to Morning Glory because she did not care for the chastity requirement demanded of followers of the goddess Diana.

While en route to join a commune near Eugene, Oregon, in 1969, Morning Glory met a hitchhiker named Gary Ferns who joined her. The two were soon married, and the next year, she gave birth to a daughter whom she named Rainbow. As a mother, she was known as Morning Glory Ferns. Although Gary and Morning Glory conducted an open marriage, the union was broken when she met Timothy Zell after he gave the 1973 keynote speech at Gnosticon in Minnesota. Morning Glory divorced Gary and brought her daughter to St. Louis, Missouri, to live with Zell. Morning Glory and Zell married at the Gnosticon of Easter 1974, the well-attended ceremony performed by Archdruid Isaac Bonewits and High Priestess Carolyn Clark.

Church of All Worlds
In St. Louis, Morning Glory studied and was made a priestess of Zell's Church of All Worlds. She helped him edit the group's journal, Green Egg. In 1976 the two began almost a decade of traveling, adventure, and living in various retreats and in a school bus they converted to a mobile home. They founded the Ecosophical Research Association in 1977 at Coeden Brith, a ranch in rural Mendocino County, California, northwest of Ukiah, to investigate arcane lore and legends of cryptids such as Bigfoot and mermaids. Their wandering years ended in 1985 when they took up permanent residence at Coeden Brith, initially for the purpose of raising ""unicorns"" created from horn surgery on baby goats, which they did.

In 1979, Timothy Zell changed his first name to Otter, and for a short time the couple styled their surnames as G'Zell, a contraction of Glory Zell. In 1994, he changed his name to Oberon.

For Morning Glory, the ideal marriage had always been an open one, and her relationship with Zell developed into a polyamorous one made up of three people from 1984 to 1994, including Diane Darling. When this arrangement ended, Zell and Morning Glory bonded with others to make a marriage of five and sometimes six. The group took the collective surname Zell-Ravenheart, and lived in two large homes. Morning Glory's May 1990 article ""A Bouquet of Lovers"", first published in Green Egg, promoted the concept of a group marriage having more than two partners. The article is widely cited as the original source of the word ""polyamory"", although the word does not appear in the article—the hyphenated form ""poly-amorous"" does instead.

With Darling, Morning Glory revived Green Egg in May 1988. The journal had been defunct since 1976. In 1990, she established the business Mythic Images, offering for sale reproductions of goddess and mythology sculptures crafted by Zell. Morning Glory ran the business in addition to lecturing and writing.

Personal life
In 1999, the Zell-Ravenhearts moved to Sonoma County, California, where Oberon started the Grey School of Wizardry, which as of 2014 is the world's only registered wizard academy.

Morning Glory went to the hospital in 2005 to treat broken bones suffered in a fall. There, she learned she had multiple myeloma. She received surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and also entreated her friends to form a healing circle. She experienced a great increase in health in 2007. She lapsed in taking her medications in late 2011, and the disease returned in early 2012. During a period of remission in August 2012 she was filmed for a documentary about polyamory for the Destination America television channel, the show called Hidden in America, the segment titled ""Polyamory in America"".

Her husband Oberon and his long term marriage partner Julie O'Ryan appeared together on screen to talk about their practice of polyamory. In reporting about the upcoming broadcast, Alan M of Polyamory in the News wrote that Morning Glory and Oberon, both battling cancer, looked ""hale and hearty"" in the preview available online.

In adolescence, her daughter Rainbow left to live with her father Gary, taking the name Gail.

Death
Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart died at her home on May 13, 2014, two weeks before her 66th birthday, of cancer.

55,"""Virtuoso"" is the 13th episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager, 133rd episode overall. It was aired on January 26, 2000 on United Paramount Network (UPN).USS Voyager, the fictional starship and the show's primary setting, is making its way slowly back to Earth from the other side of the Galaxy when they encounter Qomar aliens. These advanced aliens are intrigued by the singing abilities of The Doctor (played by cast regular Robert Picardo), indeed by music itself which despite their advanced technology they have not yet discovered.

This episode was directed by Les Landau, with a teleplay by Raf Green and Kenneth Biller from a story by Raf Green. This episode includes the Voyager band ""Harry Kim and the Kimtones"", which have a brief performance in the episode.

Plot
Voyager encounters a technologically advanced race called the Qomar, and renders aid after a Qomar crew suffers minor injuries from a reaction with Voyager's scanners. The Qomar are extremely arrogant and dismissive to everyone, and dislike the Doctor simply for being a holographic entity. However, once the Qomar happen to hear the Doctor singing, they are immediately enthralled by him, since they never conceived the concept of music.

When the Doctor explains how music is used and how many others on the ship can perform it naturally, the Qomar invite the Voyager crew to their home system—previously off limits to outsiders—to learn more about music. The Voyager crew discover thousands of subspace channels encrypted in many ways, and tons of traffic just above the home world. The Qomar decide to transmit the Doctor's singing planet-wide, and make him a star. This accentuates his vanity, making him unpopular with his friends on Voyager. He asks to leave so he can pursue his music career on the planet. This causes more anger, as the crew believes they need his medical skills and have grown to love him as a member of the crew.

The Doctor protests, even preparing Paris to take over his position, and severely upsetting Seven of Nine, who feels like she is being abandoned. However, the aliens replace him with an upgraded singing hologram capable of a greater vocal range. The Doctor's hopes for a new life are dashed. In the end, the Doctor realizes they simply wanted him for his singing, not who he is as a sentient entity. The Voyager crew welcome him back, as symbolized by Seven delivering him a fan letter praising his talent and personality, signed by Seven of Nine.

Casting 
""Virtuoso"" includes several guest stars, including Kamala Lopez-Dawson, Ray Xifo, Paul Williams, Marie Caldare, and Nina Magnesson.

Production
The shot of the Qomar homeworld is the same one previously used in the beginning of the episode ""Year of Hell.""

A clarinet (reed woodwind instrument), standup bass, and some other instruments are played in this episode.

The background the Doctor orders for his recital is based on the one from the Teatro alla Scala's set for the opera Pagliacci.

Reception 
In 2020, The Digital Fix said this was ""fun episode"" and allowed actor Robert Picardo to show off his singing.

Releases 
This episode was released as part of a season 6 DVD boxset on December 7, 2004.

56,"Prince Rong of the First Rank, or simply Prince Rong, was the title of a princely peerage used in China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1912). As the Prince Rong peerage was not awarded ""iron-cap"" status, this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank vis-à-vis that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a feng'en fuguo gong except under special circumstances.

The first bearer of the title was Yongqi (1741–1766), the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. In 1765, he was awarded the status of a qinwang (prince of the first rank) by his father under the title ""Prince Rong of the First Rank"". The title was passed down over seven generations and was held by nine persons.

""Prince Rong"" may also refer the Shunzhi Emperor's unnamed fourth son (1657–1658), who died as an infant and was given the posthumous title ""Prince Rong of the First Rank"".

Members of the Prince Rong peerage
 Yongqi (1741–1766), the Qianlong Emperor's fifth son, posthumously honoured as Prince Rongchun of the First Rank (榮純親王)
 Mianyi (綿億; 1764–1815), Yongqi's fifth son, initially a beile from 1784 to 1799, promoted to junwang in 1799, posthumously honoured as Prince Rongke of the Second Rank (榮恪郡王)
 Yihui (奕繪; 1799–1838), Mianyi's eldest son, held a beile title from 1815 to 1838
 Zaijun (載鈞; 1818–1857), Yihui's eldest son, held a beizi title from 1838 to 1857
 Pumei (溥楣; 1844–1894), Zaichuan's eldest son and Zaijun's adoptive son, held the title of a feng'en zhenguo gong from 1857 to 1866, stripped of his title in 1866
 Zaizhao (載釗; 1825–1881), Yihui's second son, held the title of a fuguo jiangjun from 1844 to 1881, posthumously honoured as a feng'en zhenguo gong in 1881
 Puyun (溥芸; 1850–1902), Zaizhao's third son, held the title of a feng'en zhenguo gong from 1866 to 1902
 Yumin (毓敏; 1878–1912), Puyun's second son, held the title of a feng'en zhenguo gong from 1902 to 1912
 Hengxu (1899–1966), better known as Jin Guangping, Yujian's son and Yumin's adoptive son, held the title of a feng'en zhenguo gong from 1912 to 1945

57,"Westdon Martin Abay (born April 5, 1971), popularly known as Dong Abay, is a poet and a Pinoy rock musician.  He was the founding member, songwriter and lead vocalist of the bands Yano, Pan, and dongabay, which are now all defunct.  In 2005, he pursued a solo career as an independent artist by releasing an album entitled Sampol.  In 2017, he formed a rock band named Dong Abay Music Organization or D.A.M.O. while having other endeavors such as a songwriting school.

Biography

Personal life 

Abay was born on April 5, 1971 in Manila, Philippines to Manuel Abay and Susana Martin. He is married to Ninj Botor Reyes. They have a son named Awit (Tagalog for ""song"" or ""chant""), born on May 15, 2002.

In January 2021, Abay was accused of being the masked rioter holding a broom during the storming  of the United States Capitol. Abay was in the Philippines at that time, and has decided to file cyber libel charges against his accusers.

Career

Yano days 

In 1992, Dong Abay, Eric Gancio and Larry Mapolon met in Patatag, a progressive vocal ensemble. After a year, they decided to form a band called NG (pronounced as en-ji and derived from the Ng digraph of the Filipino alphabet) with percussionist Renmin Nadela. Abay and Gancio remained and recruited musical arranger and bassist, Onie Badiang to the group. Eventually, the band's name was renamed to Yano.  They recorded their demo at the home studio of alternative artist Joey Ayala in June 1993.  One of the tracks, ""Kumusta Na?,"" (""How Are You?"") a song about the ""EDSA Revolution"", found its way to a local radio station where the group was first heard.  This paved the way for Yano to become active in the local club circuit.  Mayrics, Club Dredd, 70s Bistro were among the first clubs that Yano performed in. Drummers for the band included Nowie Favila (Ang Grupong Pendong), Nonong Timbalopez (Put3Ska, Ex President's Combo), Jun Nogoy (Coffeebreak Island) and Harley Alarcon (Rizal Underground). In 1994, the band's self-titled debut album came out and spawned classic Filipino rock songs such as ""Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo"" (""Holy Dog, Saintly Horse""), ""Tsinelas"" (""Slippers"") and ""Esem"" (wordplay for SM or Shoemart mall). This was followed by a string of successful concerts around the Philippine archipelago.

In 1994, at the height of Yano's popularity, Abay had to temporarily quit his schooling at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he was an Arts and Letters student, to pursue a career in music. Yano released 2 more albums under BMG, a major label : ""Bawal"" (""Taboo"") in 1996 and ""Tara"" (""C'mon"") in 1997.  The eponymous debut album was first released under Alpha Records but was later re-issued by BMG (now Sony Music Philippines).

Hiatus 

During the late 1990s, Abay suffered from clinical depression after quitting Yano.  He only stayed in his bedroom for five years. Although, Abay describe this episode as a self-imposed hiatus.  He came out of depression while writing new songs set into poetry.  He later called Badiang to borrow a guitar and jam.

Pan days 

In 2002, Abay returned to the music scene and formed Pan together with Onie Badiang, former bassist of Yano.  The outcome was an album titled ""Parnaso ng Payaso"" (""A Clown's Collection of Poetry.""- see Parnassus). Some notable songs from the album include ""Dumpsite"", ""Hula"" (""Prediction"", which won as Best Folk/Pop Recording at the AWIT Awards in 2003), ""Mabuhay!"" (""Long Live"") and ""Rebolusyon"" (""Revolution""). Pan played for the local rock circuit with bassist, Milo Duane Cruz and drummer Melvin Leyson.

In 2003, Abay decided to go back to school to finish his bachelor's degree.  Thus, the demise of Pan. Aside from his music, Abay got busy exploring other medium and art forms like installation work, visual arts, photography to name a few.  He also became busy lecturing and giving workshops around the country.

Solo career 

In early 2005, Abay became an indie artist and initially released an EP called ""Sampol"" (""Sample"") at the University of the Philippines as part of his undergraduate thesis.  This work consists of acoustic tracks, which were later reborn as full-band pieces in ""Flipino,"" released in May 2006. The album was produced by Robin Rivera, Abay's Art Studies professor in U.P. and album producer of The Eraserheads who eventually hired ex-Eraserheads Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala to play in the entire album.  ""Flipino"" proved Abay's relevance to Philippine music by releasing songs such as ""Perpekto"" (""Perfect""), ""Bombardment"" and ""Tuyo"" (""Dry"")"". A month before that, Abay finally earned his degree of Bachelor of Arts in Philippine Studies (Areas: Creative Writing in Filipino and Humanities) from the University of the Philippines after 18 long years.

2013-present 
In 2013, he released a conceptual album called Rebulto (""Bust""), which focuses entirely on the Rizal Monument along Roxas Boulevard in Manila, and written from the perspective of Jose Rizal, considered one the Philippine National Heroes, for which the monument stand, in the present day. The lyrics are mostly written in the first person, except for a couple of tracks, notably, the first track, ""Kilometro Zero"" (""Kilometer Zero""), which is a collation of facts about the Rizal Monument, all lifted from Wikipedia. (In the Philippines, the highway system uses the Rizal Monument, or kilometer zero as a reference for metric distance to any point in the country.) The album was also produced and performed by Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala.

In 2017, he formed a band called Dong Abay Music Organization or D.A.M.O. and they plan to release an album entitled Humanidad funded through crowdsourcing.

58,"Morcar (or Morkere) () (died after 1087) was the son of Ælfgār (earl of Mercia) and brother of Ēadwine. He was the earl of Northumbria from 1065 to 1066, when he was replaced by William the Conqueror with Copsi.

Dispute with the Godwins
Morcar and his brother Ēadwine, now Earl of Mercia, assisted the Northumbrian rebels to expel Tostig Godwinson. In October 1065 the Northumbrians chose Morcar as earl at York.
He at once satisfied the people of the Bernicia by making over the government of the country beyond the River Tyne to Osulf of Bamburgh the eldest son of Eadwulf III of Bamburgh, the Bernician earl, whom Siward had slain in 1041. Marching southwards with the rebels, Morcar gathered into his forces the men of Nottingham, Derby, and Lincoln, members of the old Danish confederacy of towns, and met Ēadwine, who was at the head of a considerable force at Northampton. There the brothers and their rebel army considered proposals for peace offered to them by Earl Harold Godwinson. Negotiations continued at Oxford, where, the Northumbrians insisting on the recognition of Morcar, Harold yielded on the 28th, and Morcar's election was legalised.

Events of 1066

On the death of Edward the Confessor, Morcar professedly supported Harold, but the people of his earldom were dissatisfied. Harold visited York, the seat of Morcar's government, in the spring of 1066, and overcame their disaffection by peaceful means. In the summer, Morcar joined his brother Edwin in repulsing Tostig, who was ravaging the Mercian coast. When, however, Tostig and his ally Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September, Morcar evidently was not ready to meet them; and it was not until York was threatened that, having then been joined by Edwin, he went out against them with a large army. The two earls were defeated at Fulford Gate, near York, in a fierce battle, in which, according to a Norse authority, Morcar seems to have been prominent.

York was surrendered, and Harold Godwinson had to march in haste to save the north by the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Ungrateful for this deliverance, Morcar and his brother held back the forces of the north from joining Harold, in the defence of the kingdom against the Normans. After the battle of Hastings, Morcar and his brother arrived at London, sent their sister Ealdgyth, Harold's widow, to Chester, and urged the citizens to raise one or other of them to the throne.

They concurred in the election of Edgar the Ætheling, but disappointed of their hope left the city with their forces and returned to the north, believing that the Conqueror would not advance so far. 
Before long, however, they met William of Normandy either at Berkhamstead, or more probably at Barking, after his coronation. William accepted their submission, received from them gifts and hostages, and they were reinstated. The Conqueror carried Morcar and his brother with him into Normandy in 1067, and after his return kept them at his court.

Demise and death
In 1068, they withdrew from the court, reached their earldoms, and rebelled against William. They were supported by a large number both of English and Welsh; the clergy, the monks, and the poor were strongly on their side, and messages were sent to every part of the kingdom to stir up resistance. Morcar's activity may perhaps be inferred from the prominent part taken in the movement by York. It seems probable, however, that Edgar was nominally the head of the rebellion, and that he was specially upheld by the Bernician district under Gospatric. Morcar and his brother were not inclined to risk too much; they advanced with their men to Warwick, and there made submission to the Conqueror, were pardoned, and again kept at court, the king treating them with an appearance of favour. On their defection, the rebellion came to nothing. In 1071, some mischief was made between them and the king, and William, it is said, was about to send them to prison, but they escaped secretly from the court.

After wandering about for a while, keeping to wild country, they separated, and Morcar joined the insurgents in the Isle of Ely, and remained with them until the surrender of the island. 
Morcar, it is said, surrendered himself on the assurance that the king would pardon him and receive him as a loyal friend. William, however, committed him to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, who kept him closely imprisoned in Normandy.

When the king was on his deathbed in 1087, he ordered that Morcar should be released, in common with others whom he had kept in prison in England and Normandy, on condition that they took an oath not to disturb the peace in either land. He was not long out of prison, for William Rufus took him to England, and on arriving at Winchester put him in prison there. Nothing further is known about him, and it is therefore probable that he died in prison.

Popular culture
Morcar has been portrayed by Noel Johnson in the two-part BBC TV play Conquest (1966), part of the series Theatre 625, and by Simon Rouse in the TV drama Blood Royal: William the Conqueror (1990).  He is a significant character in Man With a Sword by Henry Treece, where he and Hereward the Wake are shown becoming allies and friends in spite of some past clashes.  He is mentioned in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland when the Mouse attempts to dry itself and other characters by reciting a dry example of English history, this inclusion in Carroll's book is made interesting as he was distantly related to both Morcar and Edwin. (Martin Gardner, The Annotated Alice, Clarkson Potter, New York (1960), pp 46-7.)

60,"Decarburization (or decarbonization) is the process opposite to carburization, namely the decrease of the carbon content.

The term is typically used in metallurgy, describing the decrease of the content of carbon in metals (usually steel). Decarburization occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 °C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surfaces which are in contact with the decarburizing gas.

Decarburization can be either advantageous or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both something that can be done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step).

The decarburization mechanism can be described as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel.

Chemical reactions
The most common reactions are:

C + CO2 <=> 2CO

also called the Boudouard reaction

C + H2O <=> CO + H2

C + 2H2 <=> CH4

Other reactions are
 
C + 1/2O2 -> CO

C + O2 -> CO2

C + FeO -> CO + Fe

Electrical steel
Electrical steel is one material that uses decarburization in its production. To prevent the atmospheric gases from reacting with the metal itself, electrical steel is annealed in an atmosphere of nitrogen, hydrogen, and water vapor, where oxidation of the iron is specifically prevented by the proportions of hydrogen and water vapor so that the only reacting substance is carbon being made into carbon monoxide.

Stainless steel
Stainless steel contains additives which are highly oxidizable, such as chromium and molybdenum. Such steels can only be decarburized by reacting with dry hydrogen, which has no water content, unlike wet hydrogen, which is produced in a way that includes some water and can otherwise be used for decarburization.

As a secondary effect
Incidental decarburization can be detrimental to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative carburization, which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into the surface of the material during annealing. The decarburized surface material can also be removed by grinding.

62,"These Immortal Souls were an Australian post-punk band formed in London in 1987 by Harry Howard on bass guitar, his older brother Rowland S. Howard on guitar and vocals, Epic Soundtracks (a.k.a. Kevin Godfrey) on drums (all three ex-Crime & the City Solution) and Genevieve McGuckin on keyboards (Rowland's long time girlfriend). They issued two albums on Mute Records, Get Lost (Don't Lie)  1987 and I'm Never Gonna Die Again 1992. The group relocated to Australia in 1995 and played less frequently before disbanding there in mid-1998. Soundtracks died in November 1997 and Rowland died in December 2009.

History 

Late in 1986 Australian-born brothers Harry on bass guitar and Rowland S. Howard on guitar, and United Kingdom-born Epic Soundtracks (a.k.a. Kevin Godfrey) on drums were not invited to the recording sessions for Crime and the City Solution's album Shine. As they had already been rehearsing and recording with Genevieve McGuckin for what was seen at the time as a solo outlet for Rowland, they then became a permanent band. With Rowland's then-girlfriend, Genevieve McGuckin on keyboards, Harry, Rowland (on lead vocals and guitar) and Soundtracks formed another rock band, These Immortal Souls, in London in 1987. Rowland explained why he formed the group, ""I had lots of songs I really liked... songs that would never have been done if I hadn't said, 'Right, I'm going to sing them,' because you can't give somebody a set of lyrics and tell them what to sing if you want any kind of sincerity.""

The group's debut single, ""Marry Me (Lie! Lie!)"", was issued in September 1987. Melody Makers reviewer asked ""What possesses Rowland Howard when he writes an immaculate piece of music, something that might have qualified as the score for Romero's next film?... what spirit galvanizes this frail young man to bugger it all up by singing?"" and then answered ""It's arrogance. Punishable arrogance... in [his] black hole of insensitivity, [he goes] on to ruin the hard work of others."" A 12"" extended play version, Marry Me, with three tracks was reviewed by AllMusic's Dean McFarlane ""while the EP is astonishing, it is merely a hint of what was to come the following year... [it]features a rendition of 'Open up and Bleed' which is so devastating as to justify seeking [it] out.""

Their first studio album, Get Lost (Don't Lie!), was released in October of that year on Mute Records. The tracks were mostly written by Rowland. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their material as ""dark, ominous, challenging rock music."" The group were described by Charles Spano of AllMusic as taking a ""wander through the haze of smoky cabarets and faded photos worn at the edges."" He felt the album was ""Simultaneously rocking, strangely beautiful, and scary, [it] foreshadowed the sound of bands to come over a decade later.""

They followed with tours of Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, France, Scandinavia, United Kingdom) and a 35-date tour of the United States where the album was first non USA product released by SST Records. Back in 1982 Howard, McGuckin and US singer, Lydia Lunch, had recorded an album, Honeymoon in Red, which was released on Lunch's Widowspeak label in 1987. They had originally used Rowland's former bandmates from the Birthday Party: Nick Cave, Mick Harvey and Tracy Pew, as well as Thurston Moore (from Sonic Youth). These Immortal Souls undertook a short tour of Australia in 1988.

In 1991 Rowland and Lunch released an album, Shotgun Wedding, and toured with a live band that included his brother Harry. In 1992 These Immortal Souls issued a single ""King of Kalifornia"" (also as a 12"" EP, King of Kalifornia) and, in October, their second album, I'm Never Gonna Die Again, which was co-produced by the group with John Rivers. By that time Soundtracks was working on his solo music career and had left the group. The final European tours saw Chris Hughes (Once Upon a Time, The Fatal Shore etc.) who had previously worked with the band on an Australian tour take the drum stool. A AllMusic's Nitsuh Abebe declared the album was ""a well-handled and incredibly dramatic record that attacks with full rock force, recedes into minimal, haunting constructions, and then blasts back.""

The band moved to Melbourne Australia in 1995 where Craig Williamson joined on drums and Spencer P. Jones as second guitarist. This line-up recorded a track, ""You Can't Unring a Bell"", for a Tom Waits tribute album, Step Right Up in 1994. Other artists on that album are Pete Shelley, Tim Buckley, Violent Femmes and 10,000 Maniacs. Later Jones left the group. They continued to perform sporadically and work on new material until the band's final show at the Greyhound Hotel, St Kilda on 23 July 1998, with Lydia Lunch & Hungry Ghosts as support. Two music videos have been broadcast on ABC TV's rage: ""Marry Me (Lie! Lie!)"" and ""King of Kalifornia"".

Kevin Godfrey a.k.a. Epic Soundtracks was found dead in his London apartment on 5 November 1997; his cause of death was not identified, despite an autopsy. Rowland S. Howard died as the result of liver cancer on 30 December 2009.

63,"Frankie Goes to Hollywood is a computer game that was developed by Denton Designs and published by Ocean Software Ltd in 1985 for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum home computers.  The game is based on music, imagery and slogans of the UK band Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

Objective

The game puts the player in Liverpool in search for the Pleasuredome. The player has to find and use various objects and play minigames to reach the goal. The player starts the game as a simple character, to reach the Pleasuredome one has to become a full person. To become a full person, the four attributes (sex, war, love and faith) must be filled to 99%. The attributes are boosted by completing tasks in the game. Additional pleasure points can be scored by playing the minigames. The four attributes are part of the symbols used on the covers of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's albums.

During the game, a murder takes place. All the rooms the player can visit contain clues in order to find the murderer. The clues are in pairs, helping eliminate suspects. For example, the player may be told ""The killer is an atheist"" and ""Mr Somebody is a regular church-goer"" - so Mr Somebody would be innocent. In theory, the game cannot be completed without making the correct accusation (by returning to the room with the body) - there is a large bonus of Pleasure Points for naming the killer.

Development
The game was developed by Denton Designs and the game was based on the engine for Gift from the Gods.

Music
Certain versions of the game feature 8 bit chiptune versions of the band's songs such as ""Relax"" and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"". The ZX Spectrum version features an adaptation of ""Two Tribes"" as the title music. The game package also included a live version of ""Relax"" on tape cassette.

Reception

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that ""The graphics and game play are well done. I think you will find it an interesting game.""

In 1991, Your Sinclair included the game at number 71 in their list of the Top 100 Best Spectrum Games of All Time. In 1993, Commodore Force ranked the game at number one on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.

Sex/Pleasure/Lust
The first icon, represented by two sperm in a yin yang image, is variously described as either Sex, Lust or Pleasure. The game inlay refers to the icon as Pleasure, the music press usually referred to it as Sex, and some computer magazines occasionally used the term Lust instead.

64,"Huntingwood is a predominantly industrial suburb in the City of Blacktown, in Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Name
The composite name was chosen because the first English-style hunting is said to have taken place here and the 'Woods Estate', owned by the Woods family for nearly a century, is located within the suburb.

Transport
The M4 and Westlink M7 motorways run through the adjacent suburbs. Given this easy access to main Sydney's main arterial road network, companies such as Coles Myer and Woolworths Limited have transport and logistics complexes situated off Great Western Highway the between the Wallgrove Road and Reservoir Road exists from the M4.

Manufacturing
In 2014, a decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's Bundaberg Rum, to the western Sydney suburb of Huntingwood resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name.

Later a Diageo spokeswoman clarified by saying ""Some premium products, such as the Master Distillers Collection, would continue to be bottled in Bundaberg. This was not a decision we have taken lightly, however it is a necessary one to ensure the longer term sustainability of the distillery. We remain absolutely committed to Bundaberg and the distillery and will continue to invest and focus on our core business of distilling, maturing and blending great quality rum in Bundaberg as we have done for the last 125 years.""

66,"Massacra was one of France's leading death/thrash metal bands in the early nineties.

After recording three demos in the 1980s, they finally landed a deal with Shark Records from Germany, and released their famous debut, Final Holocaust in 1990. Unfortunately, they found themselves at odds with the label's trend-following attitude and after two successful albums, Enjoy the Violence and Signs of the Decline, they terminated their contract in 1993.

They signed a new deal with the major label Phonogram. The band decided not to rehash the same songs over and over on later releases—by the time of their fourth album (1994's Sick) the band had transformed to groove-laden mid-paced thrash metal.

The band broke up after guitarist Fred Duval died of skin cancer on 6 June 1997 at the age of 29. Some members of the band went on to form an industrial side project called Zero Tolerance in 1996, and released one album through Active Records.

67,"Hylocereus is a former genus of epiphytic cacti, often referred to as night-blooming cactus (though the term is also used for many other cacti). Several species previously placed in the genus have large edible fruits, which are known as pitayas, pitahayas or dragonfruits. In 2017, a molecular phylogenetic study confirmed an earlier finding that the genus Hylocereus was nested within Selenicereus, so all the species of Hylocereus were transferred to Selenicereus.

Description
The species previously placed in the genus Hylocereus grow hanging, climbing or epiphytic. They are freely branched, shrubby plants that form aerial roots and become very large with a height of 10 m or more. The green, often glaucous shoots are usually terete or triangular.

Taxonomy
In the 1994 classification of the International Cactaceae Systematics Group of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study, the genus Hylocereus was one of the six genera of the tribe Hylocereeae. A 2011 study of the molecular phylogeny of the Cactaceae concluded that neither the tribe nor the genus was monophyletic (i.e. neither comprised all the descendants of a common ancestor). Two species of Hylocereus formed a clade with two species of Selenicereus, suggesting that the genera were not distinct. This result was confirmed in a larger study in 2017, and all the species of Hylocereus were transferred to Selenicereus.

Species
Species that were placed in the genus in 2012 that are now placed in Selenicereus include the following.
Hylocereus calcaratus  → Selenicereus calcaratus
Hylocereus costaricensis  → Selenicereus costaricensis
Hylocereus escuintlensis  → Selenicereus escuintlensis
Hylocereus megalanthus  → Selenicereus megalanthus
Hylocereus monacanthus  → Selenicereus monacanthus

68,"A pancreatic fistula is an abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs due to leakage of pancreatic secretions from damaged pancreatic ducts. An external pancreatic fistula is one that communicates with the skin, and is also known as a pancreaticocutaneous fistula, whereas an internal pancreatic fistula communicates with other internal organs or spaces. Pancreatic fistulas can be caused by pancreatic disease, trauma, or surgery.

Signs and symptoms

Marked recent weight loss is a major clinical manifestation, and unresponsiveness of the ascites to diuretics is an additional diagnostic clue.

Pathogenesis
Internal pancreatic fistulas are most commonly caused by disruption of the pancreatic duct due to chronic pancreatitis. The chronic pancreatitis is usually alcoholic in origin in adults, and traumatic in origin in children.  They may also be caused by leakage from a pancreatic pseudocyst.

Anterior disruption of a pseudocyst or a pancreatic duct leads to leakage of pancreatic secretions into the free peritoneal cavity, leading to pancreatic ascites. If the duct is disrupted posteriorly, the secretions leak through the retroperitoneum into the mediastinum via the aortic or esophageal hiatus. Once in the mediastinum, the secretions can either be contained in a mediastinal pseudocyst, lead to enzymatic mediastinitis, or, more commonly, leak through the pleura to enter the chest and form a chronic pancreatic pleural effusion.

Diagnosis
Pleural or ascitic fluid should be sent for analysis. An elevated amylase level, usually > 1,000 IU/L, with protein levels over 3.0 g/dL is diagnostic. Serum amylase is often elevated as well, due to enzyme diffusion across the peritoneal or pleural surface. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may also assist in diagnosis, with the latter an essential component of treatment.

Types

External
An external pancreatic fistula is an abnormal communication between the pancreas (actually pancreatic duct) and the exterior of the body via the abdominal wall.

Loss of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid via a pancreatic fistula can result in a hyperchloraemic or normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Loss of a small volume of fluid will not cause a problem but an acidosis is common if the volume of pancreatic fluid lost from the body is large.

Internal
First described by Smith (1953), and elaborated upon by Cameron et al. (1976), internal pancreatic fistulas can result in pancreatic ascites, mediastinital pseudocysts, enzymatic mediastinitis, or pancreatic pleural effusions, depending on the flow of pancreatic secretions from a disrupted pancreatic duct or leakage from a pseudocyst.

Treatment
The production of pancreatic enzymes is suppressed by restricting the patient's oral intake of food patient in conjunction with the use of long-acting somatostatin analogues. The patient's nutrition is maintained by total parenteral nutrition.
This treatment is continued for 2–3 weeks, and the patient is observed for improvement. If no improvement is seen, the patient may receive endoscopic or surgical treatment. If surgical treatment is followed, an ERCP is needed to identify the site of the leak.
  
Fistulectomy is done in which the involved part of the pancreas is also removed.

69,"West Virginia Route 310 is a north–south state highway located in northern West Virginia. The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 50 in Grafton. The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 19 in Fairmont.

WV 310 is a two-lane road that traverses a mostly country setting, with sharp turns and occasional steep inclines.  It runs through the unincorporated town of Quiet Dell (Marion County) and also provides access to Valley Falls State Park.  The southern portion is located in Taylor County and the northern portion is located in Marion County.  It crosses the county line near the entrance to Valley Falls State Park.

Virtually all of the residences in the immediate area are occupied by a single family.  Homes generally have large amounts of acreage that commonly back up to wooded areas.  WV 310 runs through an area that has seen moderate growth with the development of some upscale neighborhoods such as South Point, Bunners Ridge, Timber Ridge, and Rock Lake.

WV-310 is also a main thoroughfare for individuals traveling between East Fairmont and Grafton.

WV 310 was formerly County Route 31 in Marion County and County Route 5 in Taylor County. The route's northern terminus was originally at US 250 in Fairmont, but it was extended in 2017 over the new Third Street bridge over Coal Run to US 19.

70,"Keith Mbusi Dabengwa (born 17 August 1980) is a Zimbabwean cricketer.

Dabengwa is an all-rounder who made his First class debut for Matabeleland in 2000, taking 5 for 76, he then spent a season at the CFX Academy. He continued without many spectacular performances but in 2004/05 he got selected in Zimbabwe A squad for their tours of Namibia and Bangladesh. In the first match against Bangladesh A he took five wickets and scored 50 not out.

In 2005 Dabengwa scored his highest first class score of 161 against Midlands, his only century to date. Following this, he gained a place in the national squad and made his test debut against New Zealand in Bulawayo taking two wickets for 87 runs and scoring 21 runs starting his test account by scoring a six. He played in Zimbabwe's next two tests against India. Between those games there was a tri series with India and New Zealand in this Dabengwa made his ODI debut against India in Harare.

In one Logan Cup match in 2007 he took his career best innings figures of 7 for 1. They are the best bowling figures of anyone in first class history to have taken seven wickets in an innings. The record was previously held by Fred Spofforth who took 7 for 3. However, there have been inaccuracies in the scoreboards provided by Zimbabwe Cricket and thus a question mark exists over Dadengwa's feat.

Dabengwa played for Lymington Cricket Club for the 2006 season.

Dabengwa signed for Scottish side Ferguslie for the 2013 season. After a successful season helping them win the CricHQ40 cup he returned in the summer of 2014. This season was personally more successful for Dabengwa as he scored over 700 league runs including a high score of 184 vs Greenock. He also helped Ferguslie win the WDCU CSL First Division title.

72,"Helicopter money is a proposed unconventional monetary policy, sometimes suggested as an alternative to quantitative easing (QE) when the economy is in a liquidity trap (when interest rates near zero and the economy remains in recession). Although the original idea of helicopter money describes central banks making payments directly to individuals, economists have used the term 'helicopter money' to refer to a wide range of different policy ideas, including the 'permanent' monetization of budget deficits – with the additional element of attempting to shock beliefs about future inflation or nominal GDP growth, in order to change expectations. A second set of policies, closer to the original description of helicopter money, and more innovative in the context of monetary history, involves the central bank making direct transfers to the private sector financed with base money, without the direct involvement of fiscal authorities. This has also been called a citizens' dividend or a distribution of future seigniorage.

The name ""helicopter money"" was first coined by Milton Friedman in 1969, when he wrote a parable of dropping money from a helicopter to illustrate the effects of monetary expansion. The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's Lost Decade. In November 2002, Ben Bernanke, then Federal Reserve Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.

A monetary policy that involves helicopter money requires that central banks operate with negative equity. This touches on an old question in economics on whether money should always be fully backed by segregated assets (e.a. gold, loans) or that lower levels of asset backing are warranted to counter deflationary pressures. This question is again relevant due to negative side effects of low interest rate policies as well as the development of central bank digital currency.

Origins 
Although very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including Major Douglas and the Social Credit Movement, Nobel winning economist Milton Friedman is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper ""The Optimum Quantity of Money"" (1969), where he included the following parable:

Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.

Originally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as quantitative easing. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of liquidity trap, when central banks have reached the so-called 'zero lower bound'.

Friedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the Pigou effect, in his 1968 AER Presidential address. Specifically, Friedman argues that ""[the] revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel – namely changes in wealth – whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates."" Friedman is clear that money must be produced ""in other ways"" than open-market operations, which – like QE – involve ""simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth."" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, ""Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money.""

It is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand.

Revival in the 2000s 
The idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. Ben Bernanke famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes ""once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public."" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, ""a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money."" In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future.

The Irish economist, Eric Lonergan, also argued in 2002 in the Financial Times, that central banks consider cash transfers to households as an alternative to further reductions in interest rates, also on the grounds of financial stability. In 2003, Willem Buiter, then chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  revived the concept of helicopter money in a theoretical paper, arguing that base money is not a liability, which provides a more rigorous case for Friedman and Haberler's Pigouvian intuitions.

After the global financial crisis of 2008 
In December 2008, Eric Lonergan and Martin Wolf suggested in the Financial Times that central banks make cash transfers directly to households, financed with base money, to combat the threat of global deflation.  From around 2012 onwards, some economists began advocating variants of helicopter drops, including 'QE for the people', and a 'debt jubilee' financed with the monetary base. These proposals reflected a sense that conventional policies, including QE, were failing or having many adverse effects - on either financial stability or the distribution of wealth and income.

In 2013, the chairman of the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), Adair Turner, who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.

Implementation 
Although the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income.

Under a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring. In 2016, the European Central Bank (ECB) launched a TLTRO programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks. Also, the use of differential interest rates on tiered reserves to support commercial banks' profitability in the face of negative interest rates, opens up another source of helicopter drop – albeit intermediated by banks.

In the case of the Eurozone, the use of TLTROs is believed by some economists to provide a legal and administratively tractable means of introducing transfers to households. The economist, Eric Lonergan, argued in 2016 that legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone could be structured via zero coupon, perpetual loans, which all European adult citizens would be eligible to receive. The loans could be administered by eligible commercial banks, and under certain conditions the loans would be net interest income positive to the central bank.

Other advocates such as think tank Positive Money Europe or BlackRock's Stanley Fischer and Philip Hildebrand propose to introduce helicopter money through soft forms of cooperation with fiscal authorities.

Differences from quantitative easing 
Like all expansionary monetary policies in general, quantitative easing (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an 'asset swap'. The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet.

Economists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' – that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time.

Supporters
Former chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke is known to be one of the proponents of helicopter money when he gave a speech in November 2002 arguing, in the case of Japan, that ""a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money."" In April 2016, Ben Bernanke wrote a blog post arguing that ""such programs may be the best available alternative. It would be premature to rule them out."" Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen also admitted that helicopter money could be an option in ""extreme situations.""

Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter is also known to be a prominent advocate of the concept. Other proponents include Financial Times' Chief Commentator Martin Wolf, Oxford economists John Muellbauer, and Simon Wren-Lewis, Economist Steve Keen, the political economist Mark Blyth of Brown University, Berkeley economics professor and former Treasury advisor, Brad DeLong, UCLA economics professor, Roger Farmer, American macro hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, Irish economist and Fund manager Eric Lonergan, Anatole Kaletsky, Romain Baeriswyl, Martin Sandbu, Jean Pisani-Ferry.

The idea also finds support among central bankers. For example, former governor of the Irish central bank Patrick Honohan said he believes the policy would work while the ECB's chief economist Peter Praet once said ""All central banks can do it."" The Vice-Governor of the Czech Central Bank Mojmír Hampl published a paper in which he writes that ""the idea offers many virtues and advantages compared to other forms of unconventional monetary policy, especially obliterating the need to rely on a complicated transmission mechanism, allowing much easier communication to the public, and boosting consumer confidence when most needed.""

Bill Gross, Portfolio Manager of the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund also argues for the implementation of a basic income, funded by helicopter drops.

In August 2019, prominent central bankers Stanley Fischer and Philip Hildebrand co-authored a paper published by BlackRock in which they propose a form of helicopter money.

In the Eurozone

On 10 March 2016, the idea became increasingly popular in Europe after Mario Draghi the President of the European Central Bank, said in a press conference that he found the concept 'very interesting'. This statement was followed by another statement from the ECB's Peter Praet who declared:

""Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and you distribute it to people. That’s helicopter money. Helicopter money is giving to the people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit you make on the future banknotes. The question is, if and when is it opportune to make recourse to that sort of instrument which is really an extreme sort of instrument.""

In 2015, a European campaign called ""Quantitative Easing for People"" was launched and is effectively promoting the concept of Helicopter Money, along with other proposals for 'Green QE' and 'Strategic QE' which are other types of monetary financing operations by central banks involving public investment programmes. The campaign was supported by 20 organisations across Europe and more than 116 economists.

On 17 June 2016, 18 Members of the European Parliament (including Philippe Lamberts, Paul Tang and Fabio De Masi) signed an open letter calling on the ECB to ""provide evidence-based analysis of the potential effects of the alternative proposals mentioned above, and to clarify under which conditions their implementation would be legal."" If it doesn't consider alternatives to QE, MEPs fear the ECB would leave itself ""unprepared for a deterioration in economic conditions.""

In October 2016, a survey showed that 54% Europeans think helicopter money would be a good idea, with only 14% against.

In 2020, politicians, civil society organisations and economists debated issuing helicopter money as a response to the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. While the ECB president Christine Lagarde insisted to say the ECB had not considered helicopter money, a group of 8 MEPs from different groups (including Guy Verhofstadt) said in a letter to the ECB President they were ""rather surprising to read your emphatic response"" and asked the ECB to provide further analysis on this notion.

In 2021, the French Eocnomic Advisory council, a think tank affiliated to the Prime minister's office, recommended the inclusion of helicopter money in the ECB's toolbox.

In the US
In 2020, the US legislative system debated issuing two times a $1,000 check to each eligible adult citizen, described by media as 'Helicopter Money', as a response to the US coronavirus pandemic. However, this practice cannot be considered as 'Helicopter Money' as long as this money distribution is financed by the State (debt) and not by central bank money printing (monetary expansion). Some disagree because in practice, the Federal Reserve prints money and uses it to immediately purchase debt issued by the US Treasury. Some of the Federal Reserves bond purchases have been for treasuries initially auctioned only a few days before. It can be argued that the Fed is creating money to finance the direct payments to citizens. Helicopter money delivers money directly into the hands of the public instead of quantitative easing which provides it to the bond market.

In Japan
In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda in July 2016 it was widely reported that former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke advised the policy of monetizing more government debt created to fund infrastructure projects, ostensibly as a way to drop ""Helicopter Money"" on Japan to stimulate the economy and halt deflation in Japan.  Financial markets began to front-run this stimulus effort days before it was announced when accounts of Bernanke's visit to Japan were first reported.

Later in the month the Bank of Japan in an ongoing review of its monetary stimulus program was reported to be considering policies somewhat similar to ""Helicopter Money"", such as selling 50-year or perpetual bonds.  However, even if the central bank commits to hold these 50-year government bonds for a very long time, that is not helicopter money as long as this money, financed by the state (debt) and not by central bank money printing per se, is not distributed to households directly.

Switzerland 
In October 2020, A Swiss popular initiative was started in an attempt to trigger a national referendum obliging the Swiss National Bank to distribute a 7500 CHF dividend to all Swiss citizens. Citizens have until April 2022 to collect the 100,000 required signatures.

Popular culture
Comedy heavy metal band Nanowar of Steel cited the helicopter drop monetary policy in their financial-epic-metal song ""Tooth Fairy""

Criticism

Substitution to fiscal policy 
Many economists would argue that helicopter money, in the form of cash transfers to households, should not be seen as a substitute for fiscal policy. Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons.

Inflationary effect
In the past the idea had been dismissed because it was thought that it would inevitably lead to hyperinflation.

Consequently, a range of concerns include the fact that helicopter money would undermine trust in the currency (which ultimately would lead to hyperinflation). This concern was particularly voiced by German Economist (and former Chief Economist at the ECB) Otmar Issing in a paper written in 2014. Later in 2016, he declared in an interview: ""I think the whole idea of the helicopter money is downright devastating. For this is nothing more than a declaration of bankruptcy of the monetary policy"" Richard Koo makes a similar argument when saying ""if such envelopes arrived day after day, the entire country would quickly fall into a panic as people lose all sense of what their currency is worth.""

This clashes with the argument that people would not spend much of the money they receive (and therefore helicopter money cannot be inflationary).

A study published by the French Economic Advisory Council estimates that 1% of GDP equivalent of helicopter money transfers in the Eurozone would generate around 0.5% of inflation over one year.

Would helicopter money be spent?
Several prominent economists such as central banker Raghuram Rajan are against helicopter money on the grounds that helicopter money would be ineffective because people would not spend the money. In response, Lord Adair Turner argues: ""Money financed deficits will always stimulate nominal demand. By comparison debt finance deficits might do so, but might not.""

Contradicting this argument, several surveys conducted in the Eurozone concluded however that between 30 and 55% of the distributed money would be spent by households, in effect resulting in a boost of around 2% of GDP. The most recent research on this topic was carried out by the Austrian central bank, and concludes that in the Eurozone the average marginal propensity to consume is around 50%, which is higher than previous research found.

""There is no such thing as a free lunch""
Another range of critics involve the idea that there cannot be such thing as ""free money"" or as economists say ""there is no such thing as a free lunch."" This criticism was notably expressed by Bank for International Settlements researchers Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat and Anna Zabai, who claimed that helicopter drops to citizens would necessarily involve for the central bank to pay interests on the extra reserves being supplied.

In a response, the former IMF economist Biagio Bossone challenges the later assumption and argues that ""helicopter money is a 'free lunch' in the simple sense that, if it works and succeeds in closing the output gap, people won’t have to repay it through higher taxes or undesired (above optimal) inflation.""

Legality
Other critics claim helicopter money would be outside of the mandate of central banks, because it would ""blur the lines between fiscal policy and monetary policy"" mainly because helicopter money would involve 'fiscal effects' which is traditionally the role of governments to decide on. However advocates of helicopter money such as Eric Lonergan and Simon Wren-Lewis invalidate this argument by observing that standard monetary policy tools also have fiscal effects.

The European Central Bank explained, in a letter to MEP Jonás Fernández, that ""legal complexities could still arise if the scheme could be seen as the ECB financing an obligation of the public sector vis-à-vis third parties, as this would also violate the prohibition of monetary financing."" However this refers to a very unlikely and undesirable case where helicopter money payments by the central bank would substitute to welfare payments (which are a liability of governments).

Accounting and implications for central bank balance sheets
One of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional open-market operations the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial. Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important. What matters is whether expansion of base money can be reversed in the future, or there are other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed. The European Central Bank can, in fact, mandate an increase in its capital, and the introduction of tiered reserves and interest on reserves gives central banks an array of tools to protect their own net income and the demand for reserves.

Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann also voiced opposition against helicopter money, arguing it would ""tear gaping holes in central bank balance sheets. Ultimately, it would be down to the euro-area countries, and thus the taxpayer, to shoulder the costs because central banks would be unprofitable for quite some time."" The National bank of Belgium also released a paper making a similar argument.

Threat against central bank independence 
Endra Curren and Ben Holland of Bloomberg stated ""That type of stimulus [helicopter money] used to be taboo, in part because it risks eroding the independence from politics that monetary policy makers prize [...] History is littered with cautionary tales in which blurring the lines between central bank and Treasury coffers led to runaway inflation.""

73,"Lima Allen County Airport  is six miles southeast of Lima, in Allen County, Ohio. It is owned by the Allen County Regional Airport Authority.

History
The airport is near the corner of Hanthorn Road and SR 117 east of Lima. It moved to this site in 1962; until then, the airport was a few miles northwest of Lima near the village of Elida.

Airline flights (Lake Central DC-3s) started at the old airport in 1953-54; successors Allegheny Airlines and Allegheny Commuter  continued at the new airport until the early 1970s.

In 1983/1984, Trans Midwest Airlines flew an average of 7 daily flights from Lima using Piper Navajo equipment. Nonstop flights went to CVG, CMH, DAY, & TOL with direct service to CRW, PKB, & HTS.  

The studios of local television station WTLW are in a hangar at the old airport site.

Facilities
The airport covers  at an elevation of 975 feet (297 m). Originally the airport had two runways: 10/28 is 6,000 by 150 feet (1,829 x 46 m) asphalt/fully grooved; 14/32 is 3,994 by 150 feet (1,217 x 46 m), asphalt and grass. Runway 14/32 was closed in the winter months. The grass runway was removed in 2013. Lack of use, maintenance, and never favoring a crosswind were all determining factors involved with its de-commissioning.

In the year ending June 1, 2007 the airport had 32,500 aircraft operations, average 89 per day: 80% general aviation, 18.5% air taxi, and 1.5% military. 28 aircraft were then based at this airport: 71% single-engine, 25% multi-engine and 4% jet.

74,"An online diary is a personal diary or journal that is published on the World Wide Web on a personal website or a diary-hosting website.

Overview
Online diaries have existed since at least 1994. As a community formed, these publications came to be almost exclusively known as online journals.  Today they are almost exclusively called blogs, though some differentiate by calling them personal blogs.  The running updates of online diarists combined with links inspired the term 'weblog' which was eventually contracted to form the word 'blog'.

In online diaries, people write about their day-to-day experiences, social commentary, complaints, poems, prose, illicit thoughts and any content that might be found in a traditional paper diary or journal.  They often allow readers to contribute through comments or community posting.

Modern online diary platforms may allow the writer to make entries from a PC, tablet or smartphone.  Writers might rate how they feel each day, invite someone to engage in a personal conversation or find counseling.

Early history

The first web page in an online-diary format is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's ""Open Diary"", which was published at the MIT Media Lab website from 14 November 1994 until 1996. Other early online diarists include Justin Hall, who began eleven years of personal online diary-writing in 1994, Carolyn Burke, who started publishing ""Carolyn's Diary"" on 3 January 1995, Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary The Semi-Existence of Bryon in a USENET newsgroup on 19 April 1995, David Siegel, who started his journal on 30 August 1995 and Catherine Elizabeth Clay's  'Oneopinionatedbitch.com' started off as a photographic diary in 1995 then added a full written diary 'deardementeddiary.com' currently available in print volumes with Vol. I being Life Cycles.

Online diaries soon caught the attention of the media with the publication of the book 24 Hours in Cyberspace (1996) which captured personal profiles of the people involved in early web pages. The earliest book-length scholarly discussion of online diaries is Philippe Lejeune's Cher écran, (""Dear Screen"", not yet translated into English).

The end of 1997 is generally considered the cut-off date for early adopters.

In 1998, Simon Firth described in Salon magazine how many early online diarists were abandoning the form. Yet, he said, ""While many of the movement's pioneers may be tired and disillusioned, the genre shows plenty of signs of life – of blossoming, even, into something remarkable: a new literary form that allows writers to connect with readers in an excitingly new way.""

Formation of a community
As diarists (sometimes called escribitionists) began to learn from each other, several Webrings formed to connect various diaries and journals; the most popular was Open Pages, which started in July 1996 and had 537 members as of 20 October 1998. A community website called Diarist.net was formed and awarded ""The Diarist Awards"" quarterly from 1999 through 2004.  There were a number of lists of diaries and journals by topic, called ""'burbs"", which allowed people to find sites that had some correlation to each other.

Mailing lists helped solidify the community.  ""Collabs"" were collaborative projects in which people wrote on given topics and subjects.

The launch of Open Diary in October 1998 provided the first website where online diaries could be posted together as a community. Open Diary innovated several features that would become important to online diary communities, including comments, activity feeds, and friends-only content.

Technologies
Some early diaries and journals showcased different emerging internet technologies, including interactive message formats, online stores, RealAudio, RealVideo as on the early literary blogger's website nakednovelist.com (founded in 1990), live webcams, notify lists, and daily self-photographs.

Today's diaries and journals may feature podcasts, trackbacks, permalinks, blogrolls and a host of other cutting-edge technologies.

Lifestyle
The formation of diary hosting websites such as Open Diary, Diary-X, Xanga, Femmunity and LiveJournal caused an explosive proliferation of online diaries and journals. Today, interactive online diaries, online journals, personal blogs and group blogs are integrated into the daily lives of many teenagers and college students, with communications between friends playing out online.  Even fights may be posted in the diaries, with not-so-veiled insults of each other easily readable by all their friends, enemies, and complete strangers.

Personal opinions on experiences and hobbies are very common in the blog world. Blogs have given the opportunity for people to express their views to a mass audience. With the rise of modern blogging platforms such as WordPress, blogging has become accessible to the masses.

In October 2006, the History Matters campaign, a 2006 joint project by the major heritage organizations in England and Wales, conducted the One Day in History project, asking residents of the UK to write an online diary of what they did on 17 October 2006. The diaries were stored at the British Library from November.

Non-English diaries (in Japanese)
Online diaries written in Japanese have an alternate history from ones in English world. They were called ""Web Nikki"" (web diaries) or ""Hyper Diary"" (diary written in hypertext style).

Publishing personal diaries is firmly embedded in the culture of Japan historically over a Millennium, thus Japanese tend to consider that diaries are important pieces of websites naturally even at the predawn of web history.

The first online web diary in Japanese was ""daily life"", published on 26 April 1994 by Naozumi Takenaka, who later became a famous computer engineer, at Keio University Media Center. Other early diarist Nozomi Ohmori, a translator and a literary critic, started publishing ""Kyoran Nishi-Kasai Nikki"" (frenzy Nishi-Kasai diary) at March 1995, and kept writing for 14 years. His diary was thought the longest lasting diary in the world (at the time of 2009) and published also in print.

""Nikki Links"", the first public bookmark dedicated for online diaries that was launched in 1995, went a way to increase online diarist and boosted forming diarist community. 600 diaries were registered on it by June 1996.

Afterward, publishing online diaries became a big boom along with the popularization of the Internet in Japan. Professor Kiyomi Yamashita, a psychologist of Senshu University, estimated that 240,000 online diaries written in Japan existed at the time of 2001.

Since around 2001 when blogs came in among the English world, ""Web Nikki"" in Japanese evolved into blog-style gradually. The study of blogs by Technorati in 2007 showed that 37% of blogs in the world were written in Japanese, and they had the largest share of world's blogs.

Mixi, the most popular and largest SNS in Japan, has 27 million users. It is known for its killer application ""mixi diary"" from the beginning of 2004. Most users were writing and publishing their own online diaries on mixi during the peak periods of its popularity.

75,"Provincial Trunk Highway 110 (PTH 110), also known as the Brandon Eastern Access Route, is a provincial highway in the vicinity of Brandon, Manitoba, Canada.  

PTH 110 is one of the four three-digit urban expressway routes in the Manitoba provincial highway network.  It is a two-lane highway that connects the Trans-Canada Highway (PTH 1) to PTH 10 south of Brandon.  It allows traffic going through Brandon to bypass the city, and provides easier access to the industrial areas located on the east side of the city.  The route is an important component of the City of Brandon's truck route network, as it allows dangerous goods carriers to minimize risks and traffic in urban neighbourhoods.

The first section of the highway between Richmond Avenue and PR 457, crossing the Assiniboine River, opened in 1995; PTH 110 was signed as ""TEMP PTH 110"" along PR 457 and PR 468 to connect with PTH 1. The second segment that connects Richmond Avenue to PTH 10 opened in 1999, while the last segment of the highway that connects PR 457 to the Trans-Canada Highway was completed in 2013. There is a proposal to extend PTH 110 west to the Trans-Canada Highway near Kemnay but there is no timeline for construction.

78,"In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy is a 1997 album by Pat Boone in which Boone covers hard rock and heavy metal songs in a jazz/big band style. Boone promoted the album by appearing in leather clothing (and, at that year's American Music Awards, wearing a dog collar). He succeeded in propelling Metal Mood onto the Billboard record charts (making it Boone's first hit album in 36 years), but it did not please some of his older, longtime fans who considered the heavy metal genre in bad taste, or worse. The album has since become somewhat popular as a joke gift to metal fans (as often indicated in reviews given to it) although some serious sites have given it good reviews on its own merits. The album featured guest appearances from well-known rock musicians such as Ronnie James Dio and Ritchie Blackmore.

In October of the same year, and in a similar vein, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé covered Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" in a lounge-jazz style on the 1997 compilation album release, Lounge-A-Palooza. This idea of giving rock hits a ""standards"" treatment was imitated later by Boone's contemporary Paul Anka in the 2005 album Rock Swings, which also featured Anka doing a cover of ""Black Hole Sun"".

79,"Securin is a protein involved in control of the metaphase-anaphase transition and anaphase onset. Following bi-orientation of chromosome pairs and inactivation of the spindle checkpoint system, the underlying regulatory system, which includes securin, produces an abrupt stimulus that induces highly synchronous chromosome separation in anaphase.

Securin and Separase

Securin is initially present in the cytoplasm and binds to separase, a protease that degrades the cohesin rings that link the two sister chromatids. Separase is vital for onset of anaphase.  This securin-separase complex is maintained when securin is phosphorylated by Cdk1, inhibiting ubiquitination.  When bound to securin, separase is not functional.

In addition, both securin and separase are well-conserved proteins (Figure 1). Note that separase cannot function without initially forming the securin-separase complex.  This is because securin helps properly fold separase into the functional conformation.  However, yeast does not appear to require securin to form functional separase as anaphase occurs in yeast with a securin deletion mutation.

Role of Securin in the onset of Anaphase

Basic mechanism

Securin has 5 known phosphorylation sites that are targets of Cdk1; 2 sites at the N-terminal in the Ken-Box and D-box region are known to affect APC recognition and ubiquitination (Figure 2).  To initiate the onset of anaphase, securin is dephosphorylated by Cdc14 and other phosphatases.  Dephosphorylated securin is recognized by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) bound primarily to Cdc20 (Cdh1 is also an activating substrate of APC).  The APCCdc20 complex ubiquitinates securin and targets it for degradation by 26S proteasome.  This results in free separase that is able to destroy cohesin and initiate chromosome separation.

Network characteristics

It is thought that securin integrates multiple regulatory inputs to make separase activation switch-like, resulting in sudden, coordinated anaphase.  This likely involves a network with several feedback loops, including positive feedback which leads to switch-like behavior.  One proposed signaling pathway generating switch-like behavior contains a positive feedback loop for activation of Cdc14 by separase, leading to dephosphorylation and degradation of securin (Figure 3).

David Morgan’s group found that segregation time of chromosomes 4 and 5 is significantly elongated in budding-yeast strains with mutations in the 2 N-terminal securin phosphorylation sites and securin deletion strains.  In addition, these mutant strains exhibited very high rates of mis-segregation compared to normal behavior.  Switch-like characteristics are necessary to trigger quick, coordinated chromosomal segregation in anaphase.  This means that strong inactivation of separase by securin followed by sudden, rapid destruction of securin and activation of separase is vital for proper anaphase.

Overall, securin and separase act in an anaphase-regulating network.  Figure 4 depicts a potential network diagram.

82,"Tivoli Software encompasses a set of products originally developed by Tivoli Systems Inc.  IBM bought the company and ran the operation as its Tivoli Software division.  Additional products were acquired and run under the Tivoli portfolio brand.  IBM began phasing out use of the Tivoli brand in 2013 and by 2016 had moved the portfolio products into a revised and rebranded hierarchy.

History of Tivoli brand

Tivoli Systems Inc. was founded in Austin, Texas in 1989 by Bob Fabbio and quickly joined by Peter Valdes,  Todd Smith and Steve Marcie; all were former IBM employees.  Bob Fabbio in an interview indicated the purpose was to provide systems management on systems from a diverse set of vendors while at IBM he had been directed to focus on IBM products only. As an independent software vendor Tivoli Systems developed and sold Tivoli Management Environment (TME) ""systems management"" software and services.  The then CEO Frank Moss saw the company listed on NASDAQ in March 1995 and the subsequent merger into IBM in 1996. 

At the start of 2002, Tivoli Systems Inc, became Tivoli Software, a brand within IBM. IBM initially grew the software portfolio under the Tivoli brand through development and acquisition.  There are some thoughts this may have resulted in the brand containing a large set of overlapping and marginal products  In April 2013 IBM renamed ""Tivoli Software"" Division to ""Cloud & Smarter Infrastructure"".  IBM moved away from the Tivoli brand as exemplified by the explicit rebranding of Tivoli Storage Manager to IBM Spectrum Protect and the renaming of IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler to IBM Workload Scheduler as of release 9.3.

Market position

According to IT analyst research firm Gartner, Inc., IBM in 2012 owned the largest share of the ""IT Operations Management"" software market, with an 18% market share. IBM was also the leading provider of Enterprise Asset Management software, for the 7th consecutive year, according to ARC Advisory Group, a research analyst firm for industry and infrastructure.

Service management segments

Service management segments related to the Tivoli brand software and services included the following:

 Virtualization Management
 Storage Management
 IT Service Management
 Application Performance Management
 Network Management
 System and Workload Automation 
 Server, Desktop, Mobile Device Management & Security

Tivoli Management Framework 

Tivoli Management Framework (TMF) is a CORBA-based systems and network management framework.  It allows administrators to manage large numbers of remote locations or devices. In the early years of TMF's lifecycle it was a pre-requisite to several other key Tivoli components.  With IBM's adoption and promotion of other non-TMF based products, such as Micromuse Netcool Omnibus in February 2006 and the increasing general acceptance of Secure Shell in preference to CORBA meant TMF entered the latter stages of product lifecycle.  The final independent release version of TMF was 4.1.1 with release 4.3.1 supplied with and to Tivoli Configuration Manager 4.3.1 in 2008.

83,"""Ti Voglio Qui"" is the second single by Australian pop singer Tina Arena from her 1997 album In Deep and the Italian version of its hit lead single Burn. As an alternate language version of a hit single, this release lacked substantial mainstream appeal and therefore failed to make any significant commercial or chart impact unlike its highly successful English counterpart.  Despite being released at the same time, the two songs are often credited as the first and second singles from the In Deep album.  It is credited as a single released from this album due to its connection to ""Burn"" and the two songs' simultaneous releases, despite being a non-album track.  This quickly made its limited CD Single a highly sought-after collector's item, as it was the only way to obtain this song until it was re-released on the limited edition 2CD version of the Greatest Hits 1994-2004 album.  Although this version of the album is now out of print, the song can still be purchased from a number of Australian legal music download services.  A Spanish version of ""Burn"" was also recorded and released as a bonus track on the versions of the In Deep album released in a number of South American countries.

Song information
""Burn"" was written by Tina Arena, Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel, with the Italian adaptation done by Fabrizio V Zee Grossi.  Both versions were produced by Mick Jones.

86,"HMS Somerset was an 80-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built to the 1719 Establishment at Woolwich and launched on 21 October 1731. She was the second ship to bear the name.

Lord George Rodney, later to triumph at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782, served on HMS Somerset in 1739 while preparing for his Lieutenant's exams. The ship saw action at the Battle of Toulon in 1744. Toulon was an infamous engagement and consequently no battle honour was awarded. A combined Franco-Spanish fleet that had been blockaded in Toulon for two years finally put to sea, led by Admiral de Court de La Bruyère. The blockading British fleet under Admiral Thomas Mathews was roughly the same size as the Franco-Spanish fleet but fearing that the enemy fleet movement was designed to force him out of position and allow a troop convoy to reach Italy, Mathews ordered his fleet to attack before forming up into line. Admiral Richard Lestock, Mathew's second in command, appears to have deliberately misunderstood his orders, and the resulting battle was indecisive, with the British taking more damage than they inflicted. Mathews was dismissed from the Navy for failing to obey permanent fighting instructions for battle.

Somerset was broken up in 1746.

87,"The Sir Dorabji Tata Trust was established by Sir Dorab Tata (fondly called Sir Dorabji), the elder son of Tata Group founder Jamsetji Tata. Founded in 1932, it is one of the oldest non-sectarian philanthropic organisations in India.

History

Like his respected father, Sir Dorabji believed that one must make use of the wealth one had acquired for constructive purposes. So, in less than a year after his wife Meherbai's death, he donated all his wealth to the Trust, insisting that it must be used ""without any distinction of place, nationality or creed"", for the advancement of learning and research, the relief of distress and other charitable purposes. He died three months later.

The wealth that he turned over to the Trust comprised his substantial share holdings in Tata Sons, Indian Hotels and allied companies, his landed properties and 21 pieces of jewellery left by his wife, including the famous Jubilee Diamond, estimated then to be of the value of Rs 10 million. Today, these would be worth more than Rs 500 million.

Mission
As the Trust got formed and the trustees deliberated on the policy aspects and finalised them, it decided to adopt a broad framework—that it should undertake such projects, which are too large for individuals to handle and that each of these projects should have a genuine relevance to the welfare of the country. The Trust is mandated to:

 Maintain and support schools, educational institutions and hospitals
 Provide relief in distress caused by the elements of nature such as famine, pestilence, fire, tempest, flood, earthquake or any other calamity
 Help advancement of learning in all its branches especially research work in medical and industrial problems
 Offer financial aid to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, by instituting professorships or lectureships or giving scholarships
 Award fellowships in any branch of science or assist students to study abroad either by payment of lump sums grants or by payment of periodical sums
 Give aid to any other charitable institutions or objects endowed by the settler in his lifetime, or by the grandfather, father or both of the settler.

Notable national institutes
The Trust is best known for promoting and setting up pioneering institutions of national importance.

Each of these institutions works in frontier areas of learning, research and knowledge dissemination. The ideas that have generated from these institutions and the people who have passed through their portals have enriched the various facets of India's development. Each of these institutions has produced many social scientists, cancer specialists, nuclear scientists and distinguished institutional administrators who have all strived to make the country a power to reckon with in science and technology.

In the last decade, the Trust has also given shape to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore and helped the Dr MS Swaminathan Research Foundation to start the JRD Tata Centre for Ecotechnology in Chennai.

In addition to these institutions, it has started with the assistance of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, Asia's first institute for the training of the rural blind, The Tata Agricultural and Rural Training Centre for the Blind, and with the cooperation of the United Nations, the International Institute of Demographic Studies.

The Trust also helps various organisations and individuals with its grants. Its grants consist of Endowment Grants, grants to Non-Governmental Organisations and Small Grants, while Individual Grants are given to deserving individuals for medical, travel or educational purposes.

Under JRD Tata
What has helped the Trust in achieving its objectives has been the presence of distinguished personalities, most of them industry pioneers, on its board. Among them were JRD Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, Sir Ardeshir Dalal, Dr John Matthai and Sir Homi Mody.

The involvement of JRD Tata in the affairs of Trust is not just incidental. Being a trustee since the Trust's inception, he held the position of chairman during the last 25 years of his life. His imprint is visible in the setting up of the Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Studies and National Centre for the Performing Arts. His role was especially crucial in the establishment of the Tata Memorial Hospital. Right from its conceptual stages in early 1941, till it became a national centre for cancer research and treatment, JRD Tata was there all along to guide its destinies. In 1957, when the government of India's ministry of health temporarily took over the Tata Memorial Hospital, JRD Tata, along with Dr Homi Bhabha, the pioneer of India's nuclear energy programme, had the vision to foresee the role of radiation in cancer treatment and prevailed on the government to have the administrative control of the hospital transferred to the department of atomic energy in 1962.

He had also put his own money and efforts to set up, in 1944, the multipurpose JRD Tata Trust. Many years later, he established the JRD and Thelma J Tata Trust, selling part of his shares and an apartment in Mumbai. The Trust works to improve the lot of India's disadvantaged women.

Tata Memorial Hospital

What is typical of the Trust is that after establishing pioneering institutions, giving them shape and stabilising them, the Trust has handed over their day-to-day running to the Government of India. Thus, The Tata Memorial Hospital is now under the government, run by the department of atomic energy.

Tata Institute of Fundamental Research

The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research too has been handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research today is a Deemed University.

In the case of TISS and the TIFR, the chairmen of the boards have so far been the representatives of the Tata Trusts. The Trust is represented on the governing council of the Tata Memorial Hospital. However, the Trust still takes interest in these institutions and contributes its mite to their running.

As neither Sir Dorabji nor Sir Ratan had any children, their holdings could well have been fragmented and with them Tata Sons. The Trusts that Sir Dorabji and Sir Ratan set up gave to Tata Sons a cohesive and a continuing character over decades.

The Trust sanctioned institutional grants, as well as grants to private individuals. The total disbursal made by the Trust in the fiscal year 2003 - 2004 was Rs 442.39 million.

89,"The Siri thesis is the assertion that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, the conservative Archbishop of Genoa since 1946, was elected pope in the 1958 papal conclave, taking the name Pope Gregory XVII, but that his election was then suppressed. Siri did not associate himself with this idea, which is held by a small minority of traditionalist Catholics.

Its exponents claim that a prolonged emission of white smoke on the first day of balloting at the conclave indicated the election of Siri, but that threats applied from outside the conclave caused his election to be reversed, allowing Pope John XXIII to be elected two days later. The source of the threats has been identified variously as Freemasons and agents of the Soviet Union. Adherents of the Siri thesis say that the election of John XXIII was invalid. They regard him and his successors as imposters and antipopes.

1958 conclave
On 25 October 1958, 51 cardinals entered the papal conclave, which was held to elect a successor to Pope Pius XII. Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, then 52 years old, was considered a strong candidate in the election. Siri was viewed then, and throughout his life, as staunchly conservative.

At 11:53a.m. on the morning of 26 October, the first day of balloting, white smoke was seen coming from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, a traditional signal to the crowds in the square outside that a pope has been elected. It was followed after a few minutes by black smoke. The Italian radio network and the Italian news agency had to retract their initial reports that a pope had been elected. Something similar happened in the afternoon at 5:53p.m. when the smoke again appeared white. At 6p.m., after the smoke had continued white for several minutes, Vatican Radio told the world: ""The smoke is white... There is absolutely no doubt. A Pope has been elected."" After about half an hour, the smoke turned black, indicating that there was no result. Vatican Radio corrected its report. The New York Times said that ""The crowd lingered for more than a half hour, apparently hoping against hope that a new Pope would appear."" The paper reported that problems getting the straw to catch fire likely caused the morning’s problem and said ""The second signal was misunderstood because it came well after nightfall. The smoke was lighted from below by a spotlight, which made black appear white.""

The official responsible for arrangements outside the conclave notified the cardinals that the colour of the smoke had been misread and provided them with ""smoke torches from a fireworks factory"". The third day's four ballots again failed to select a pope and there was no confusion about the colour of the smoke. On the afternoon of the next day, 28 October, white smoke signalled the election of a pope. On their eleventh ballot the conclave had elected Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, who took the name John XXIII.

While Siri was considered a favourite for election before the conclave, he did not feature in the early voting, and ultimately was never in the running. He was thought too young at 52; a long pontificate would have been anticipated, and this was allegedly felt to be undesirable because a long pontificate would have prevented other cardinals who wanted to be elected pope from having the chance of being elected.

History of the thesis
Sometime in the late 1980s, an American traditionalist Catholic named Gary Giuffre began to expound the belief that Siri was the true pope, and that he was being held against his will in Rome. According to Giuffre and supporters of the theory, the white smoke that was seen on 26 October 1958 did indeed mean that a pope had been elected, and that pope was Siri, but he was forced to surrender the papacy in the face of dire threats from outside the conclave. Giuffre speculates the main threat was that Rome would be destroyed with a thermonuclear weapon, effectively wiping out the entire hierarchy of the Church in one blow. With the electors unsure of how to proceed, Roncalli, who they claim was a Freemason, supposedly offered himself as a compromise with the promise that he would call a synod soon after his election to regularize the unusual situation.  Roncalli was elected as John XXIII instead of Siri. It is claimed Roncalli purposely chose the same name as Antipope John XXIII as an acknowledgment of his irregular status.

The thesis further claims that a similar process occurred at the 1963 conclave that followed John XXIII's death. Once again white smoke was seen indicating that Siri had been elected, and again it turned black and, under threats from outside the conclave, a different cardinal was elected, Giovanni Montini, who took the name Paul VI. During this conclave, it was alleged that the threats of terrible retribution if Siri were elected were passed into the conclave by the B'nai B'rith, working on behalf of a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy.

The assertion that Siri's 1963 election had been set aside after the intervention of the B'nai B'rith was contained in an article written in 1986 by Louis Hubert Remy in a French publication, , and translated into English in 1987 for Dan Jones's newsletter, The Sangre de Cristo Newsnotes. That article made no mention of the 1958 conclave. Malachi Martin, in his apocalyptic 1990 book The Keys of This Blood, said that in the 1963 conclave Siri received sufficient votes for election, but refused it. The reason, according to Martin, was that he believed that ""only thus could foreseen possibilities of grave danger be avoided—but whether harm to the Church, his family, or to him personally, is not clear."" Siri's refusal, he says, followed a conversation on the subject of Siri's candidacy between a member of the conclave and somebody outside it, who was ""an emissary of an internationally based organisation"". In a 1997 interview on the radio programme Steel on Steel, hosted by John Loefller, Martin claimed that Siri had also obtained a majority of votes in the first 1978 conclave, but that he had received a written note after his election threatening him and his family with death should he accept. Followers of the ""Siri thesis"" recognize him as ""Gregory XVII"", and also refer to him as ""the Red Pope"".

Paul L. Williams, in a 2003 book entitled The Vatican Exposed, claimed that US State Department documents confirmed that Siri had been elected pope in 1958 as Gregory XVII. According to Williams, however, the election was quashed not by a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, but by fear of the Soviet Union. Roncalli, he claims, was known as the ""pink priest"" because of his ties with both the French and Italian Communist parties, while Siri was ""rabidly anti-Communist"". Siri received the requisite number of votes on the third ballot, and was elected as Gregory XVII, but ""the French cardinals annulled the results, claiming that the election would cause widespread riots and the assassination of several prominent bishops behind the Iron Curtain."" It was then decided to elect Cardinal Federico Tedeschini, but as he was too ill, Roncalli was elected instead. Williams cited ""Department of State secret dispatch, 'John XXIII,' issue date: November 20, 1958, declassified: November 11, 1974"" and ""Department of State secret file, 'Cardinal Siri,' issue date: April 10, 1961, declassified: February 28, 1994"" in support of his claims. In subsequent editions, however, the references were changed to simply ""F.B.I. source"".

Significance
Traditionalist Catholics oppose the liturgical changes and ""modernist"" theological positions resulting from the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), which many of them see as a ""heretical"" council. Sedevacantists are a minority group within traditionalist Catholicism, who maintain that none of the popes from John XXIII (who called the council) onward were true popes, and that therefore the papal seat is vacant (). The idea that John XXIII and Paul VI were not true popes, but antipopes, is neatly explained by the Siri thesis: if Siri was elected in 1958, then the election of John, and therefore of all his successors, was invalid. The Catholic magazine Inside the Vatican has referred to adherents of the Siri thesis as ""sede impeditists"", meaning that they believe there was a true pope, but that he was ""impeded"" by outside forces from taking his office. The magazine estimated that the thesis was believed ""by hundreds, perhaps thousands of people around the world"".

Siri's later career
Siri is not recorded as ever having made reference to the ""Siri thesis"", nor was there any mention of it in his New York Times obituary, in the biography written by Raimondo Spiazzi, or in a speech given by Giulio Andreotti on the centenary of Siri's birth in 2006. He was appointed president of the Italian Episcopal Conference by John XXIII in 1959, and remained in the post under Paul VI until 1964. He sat on the Board of Presidency of the Second Vatican Council from 1963 until its close in 1965. He was a candidate for pope in the 1978 conclave that followed the death of Paul VI, where he is thought to have led in the early ballots before being overtaken by Albino Luciani (John Paul I), and again two months later in the October 1978 conclave, where he is also thought to have come within a few votes of election. He was Archbishop of Genoa from 1946 to 1987, and at the time of his retirement he was ""the last remaining active cardinal named by Pope Pius XII.""

90,"Staggered Crossing, sometimes nicknamed StagX, were a Canadian rock band formed in 1996 in Toronto.

History

Early years 
The original group was formed in 1996 (according to some sources about 1997) in Toronto by four high school friends, Julian Taylor (JT), David E.G. Marshall, Dan Black and Jeremy Elliott.  The group quickly gained a local following in North Toronto due to their frequent performances.  Later in 1996 they recorded their first EP with Toronto musician and producer, Darrell O'Dea

In 1997 David Marshall quit the group because he had entered the University of Montreal. The group had to find a new lead guitarist. They re-formed the group cast by adding Darrell O'Dea, their producer, and having found a new guitarist Bruce Adamson. Staggered Crossing firmly made their reputation in Toronto and gained a lot of fans playing in the venues such as Lee's Palace, the Horseshoe Tavern, Reverb, the El Mocambo now as a permanent member. 

In 1997 producer and publisher, Frank Davies, president of The Music Publisher (TMP), after listening to their first EP signed with them.  During their joint cooperation from 1997 to 1999 almost 40 songs were written and recorded by the group.

Warner Music (1999-2001)
The band were signed to Warner Music Canada in 1999. Later that year, the band signed with manager Larry Wanagas, founder of Bumstead Records, who had managed acts such as Big Sugar, k.d. lang, Susan Aglukark, The Trews and BOY. On February 27, 2001, Staggered Crossing was released their self-titled full-length debut album in Canada. The band's debut single, ""Further Again,"" reached #7 on the Canadian rock charts and ended the year as the sixth most played song on rock radio in Canada. ""A Million Works of Art"" and ""Old Man"" were also released as singles. The debut album went on to sell 15,000 copies in Canada according to SoundScan.

The band continued to tour and perform across Canada with groups such as Big Sugar, Blue Rodeo, Nickelback, The Guess Who, Midnight Oil, 54-40, Wide Mouth Mason, Crowbar, and Spirit of the West. Other highlights included an appearance on Open Mike with Mike Bullard and the Canadian Organization of Campus Activities naming their self-titled album the ""Best Contemporary Music Recording of the Year"" at Universities and Colleges in 2001.

Bruce Adamson left the group to further his career in publishing and law in 2001.  In an attempt to return to the sound of their early years the band parted with producer and band member, Darrell O'Dea. The band also parted ways over creative differences later that year with Warner Music Canada, opting instead to start their own label.

Independent Record Label
After Staggered Crossing organised their own ""publishing company and record label, Bent Penny Records"" their former guitarist David Marshall started playing with them since 2001. The band's next album, Last Summer When We Were Famous, was released in August 2002. The album was produced by Jay Bennett of Wilco fame.

In 2004, they released the album Burgundy & Blue. ""Perfect Prize"" was released as a single and peaked at #17 on Canada's Rock chart.

Breakup
Following a number of recording sessions referred to as ""1978"", the year in which all four members were born, the band officially announced their breakup on August 29, 2007. In a press release the band assured fans and the media that their parting was amiable, stating:

... While it would certainly be more fun to announce a break up because of 'creative differences' or because of some monumental and catastrophic fight between bandmates, neither is the case. We simply cannot continue to commit the time, energy and enthusiasm to this band that we love so much. We are still great friends and this change is not the end of our musical collaborations.

The band announced one final show, which was performed at The Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto on November 2, 2007. However, the band continued to play together on an informal basis. Notably, the band reunited for a concert at the Horseshoe Tavern on July 9, 2009, to pay tribute to the music of Jay Walter Bennett, who produced the band's Last Summer When We Were Famous album. Bennett had recently died. Bruce Adamson, Dan Black, Julian Taylor, David Marshall and Jeremy Elliott were all present. In conjunction with the concert, a tribute single entitled 'Pull You Through' and written by Bennett's former band Titanic Love Affair was released to Canadian radio .

The band reunited to open for Blue Rodeo at the Nepean National Equestrian Park on August 21, 2010. Ben Spivak played keyboards.

The band also performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto on December 3, 2011 as part of the long-standing Christmas show: 'StagXmas Bash'.

Bruce Adamson died December 15, 2015 in Toronto.

Drummer Jeremy Elliott and Singer/Guitarist Julian Taylor now perform & record as part of the Julian Taylor Band, and have released two albums: 'Tech Noir' in 2014, and the double album 'Desert Star' on Aporia Records in 2016.

For one night only on April 20, 2020 the surviving members will take the stage at Lees Palace as the support act for their friend and former label mate, J. Englishman to celebrate the 20th Anniversary celebration of his debut album.

91,"North Shore Australia Football Club, known informally as the North Shore Bombers is an Australian rules football club competing in the Sydney AFL Premier League and based out of the Sydney suburb of St Leonards, New South Wales. Formed in 1903 it remains one of only three foundation clubs still in existence and generally recognised as one of the more successful clubs of Sydney AFL. The club's current home ground is Mortgage Choice Oval (also known as Gore Hill Oval) in St. Leonards, next to the Royal North Shore Hospital. Gore Hill Oval was redeveloped in 2018 and re-opened in 2019; and is believed to be the first or second senior AFL ground to have a synthetic surface.

Previously nicknamed the Bears, the club has the same playing strip and now logo as the Essendon Football Club in the AFL.
In 2021, the Mens Senior coach is Lloyd Perris and the Womens Senior coach is Locky Pryor. The club's President is John Goode.
The club fields 14 teams in the Sydney AFL league. The seniors compete in the Premier Division; the reserves are in the Premier Division Reserves. Under AFL Sydney's revised divisional structure, North Shore will field their third grade team in Division One, their fourths in Division Two, fifths in Division Three and sixths in Division Four.
The Under 19s compete in the top Division One competition, in which they have appeared in four Grand Finals in a row from 2014–17, winning premierships in 2015 and 2016; and in 2021 will defend their 2020 premiership. They also field a team in the Under 19s Division Two competition.
North Shore fielded a Women's team for the first time in 2017, playing in the Women's Division One competition. Growth in the numbers of players in women's footy has seen the club nominate a second women's team in 2018, a third in 2019 and five teams in 2020 and 2021; with the Bombers promoted to Womens Premier Division.

History
The club formed in 1903, one of only three remaining foundation clubs, and since then has won thirteen senior premierships. The Bombers competed in 6 Grand Finals in a row from 2000–2005, winning premierships in 2001, 2004 & 2005. Although the Bombers failed to qualify for the finals in 2006, they bounced back in 2007 to take their 13th premiership.
In 2008, after a slow start to the season, the Bombers finished strongly to qualify for the final five, but were eliminated in the first finals match. They failed to qualify for the finals in 2009, but finished fifth in 2010 and fourth in 2011, 2012 and 2013. After missing the finals in 2014 and 2015; they have made the finals in every season since 2016, finishing in the top 2 after the home and away rounds in each season.

With strong junior numbers coming through the ranks, from 2006 to 2008 North Shore fielded two teams in the Under 18s Premier Cup, Sydney AFL's strongest under-18s competition. One of their teams, the Bombers, took out the premiership in 2006 and 2008; while their other team, the Wildcats, took out the 2007 title undefeated. In 2008, the Wildcats changed their name to the Bears. However, the introduction of a divisional structure in the Sydney AFL competition, with a limit of one team per club in each division, saw North Shore only field one under 18s team from 2009 onwards.
Strong player numbers coming through the junior pathway saw the club field a second Under 19s team in the Division Two competition from 2016.

North Shore have always fielded seniors and reserves teams. With solid growth in player numbers, a third open-age team was entered in 2011; competing in Division Three under the league's divisional structure. The thirds team was relegated after its first season, and now competes in Division Four. Continued growth in numbers saw a fourth open-age team entered in Division Five in 2014 and a fifth team in 2018.

Senior premierships: 1904, 1910, 1921, 1952, 1961, 1978, 1979, 1985, 1991, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007.

94,"Goldstein College, University of New South Wales is one of the three original Kensington Colleges along with Phillip Baxter and Basser College, located in Australia. In 2012 and 2013, Goldstein residents resided in Baxter College during the University of New South Wales (UNSW) major student accommodation redevelopment project.

History
Goldstein College is the smallest of the three Kensington Colleges at the University of New South Wales. The newly completed Goldstein College building houses 150 residents. The residents of the college are of local, rural and international students.

The original Goldstein College was opened on 30 June 1964, along with the Goldstein Dining Hall which is shared by all residents of The Kensington Colleges. The college was designed by Government Architect, E.H. Farmer, and a member of his staff, Peter Hall, who later succeeded Jørn Utzon as supervising architect of the Sydney Opera House. The Goldstein Dining Hall won the Sulman Award for architecture in 1966.

Goldstein College was named after Phillip Godfrey Goldstein (1895-1963), who arrived in Australia in 1911 from England. In 1959 he donated £40,000 (Australian) towards the construction of the Dining Hall and College. The College initially housed women and postgraduate students, being the first college accommodation for women on the UNSW campus.

House Committee
Goldstein College is governed by a student run House Committee under the supervision of the Dean of College.

Redevelopment 
The redeveloped Goldstein College opened in Semester 1, 2014.  It accommodates 150 students in a mixture of rooms with either en suites or shared bathroom facilities. The College shares landscaped garden spaces with Basser, Philip Baxter and the newly established residences; Fig Tree Hall and Colombo House. Residents are provided with three meals per day (during session) at the Goldstein Dining Hall, which is shared with the other Kensington Colleges - Basser and Philip Baxter and Fig Tree Hall. The Dining Hall has undergone a major refurbishment while retaining the design features and fixtures of the original interior.

95,"Termessos (Greek Τερμησσός Termissós) was a Pisidian city built at an altitude of more than 1000 metres at the south-west side of the mountain Solymos (modern-day Güllük Dağı) in the Taurus Mountains (modern-day Antalya province, Turkey). It lies 17 kilometres to the north-west of Antalya. It was founded on a natural platform on top of Güllük Dağı, soaring to a height of 1,665 metres from among the surrounding travertine mountains of Antalya.

Concealed by pine forests and with a peaceful and untouched appearance, the site has a more distinct and impressive atmosphere than many other ancient cities. 

Termessos is one of the best preserved of the ancient cities of Turkey. The city was founded by the Solims, who were mentioned by Homer in the Iliad in connection with the legend of Bellerophon.

Because of its natural and historical riches, the city has been included in a national park bearing its name, the Mount Güllük-Termessos National Park.

History
 

The mythical founder of the city is Bellerophon.

What is known of Termessos' history commences principally at the time that Alexander the Great surrounded the city in 333 BC; he likened the city to an eagle's nest and in one of few cases, failed to conquer it. Arrian, one of the ancient historians who dealt with this event and recorded the strategic importance of Termessos, notes that even a small force could easily defend it due to the insurmountable natural barriers surrounding the city. The location of the city at the mountain pass from the Phrygian hinterland to the plains of Pamphylia is described by Arrian, Annals 1,26,6. Alexander wanted to go to Phrygia from Pamphylia, and according to Arrian, the road passed by Termessos. There are other passes much lower and easier to access, so why Alexander chose to ascend the steep Yenice pass is still a matter of dispute. It is even said that his hosts in Perge sent Alexander up the wrong path. Alexander wasted a lot of time and effort trying to force his way through the pass, which had been closed by the Termessians, and so, in anger he turned toward Termessos and surrounded it. Probably because he knew he could not capture the city, Alexander did not undertake an assault, but instead marched north and vented his fury on Sagalassos.

According to Strabo, the inhabitants of Termessos called themselves the Solymi and were a Pisidian people. Their name, as well as that given to the mountain on which they lived, was derived from Solymeus, an Anatolian god who in later times became identified with Zeus, giving rise there to the cult of Zeus Solymeus (Solim in Turkish). This name still exists as a surname in some people in Antalya region, providing evidence to their Solymi heritage. The coins of Termessos often depict this god and give his name.

The historian Diodorus has recorded in full detail another unforgettable incident in the history of Termessos. In 319 BC, after the death of Alexander, one of his generals, Antigonos Monophtalmos, proclaimed himself master of Asia Minor and set out to do battle with his rival Alcetas, whose base of support was Pisidia. His forces were made up of some 40,000 infantry, 7,000 cavalry, and included numerous elephants as well. Unable to vanquish these superior forces, Alcetas and his friends sought refuge in Termessos. The Termessians gave Alcetas their word that they would help him.

At this time, Antigonos came and set up camp in front of the city, seeking delivery of his rival. Not wanting their city to be dragged into disaster for the sake of a Macedonian foreigner, the elders of the city decided to hand Alcetas over to Antigonos. However, the youths of Termessos wanted to keep their word and refused to go along with the plan. The elders sent Antigonos an envoy to inform him of their intent to surrender Alcetas. According to a secret plan to continue the fight, the youth of Termessos managed to leave the city. Learning of his imminent capture and preferring death to being handed over to his enemy, Alcetas killed himself. The elders delivered his corpse to Antigonos. After subjecting the corpse to all manner of abuse for three days, Antigonos departed Pisidia leaving the corpse unburied. The youth, greatly resenting what had happened, recovered Alcetas' corpse, buried it with full honours, and erected a beautiful monument to his memory.

Termessos was obviously not a port city, but its lands stretched south-east all the way to the Gulf of Attaleia (Antalya). Because the city possessed this link to the sea it was taken by the Ptolemies.

An inscription found in the Lycian city of Araxa yields important information about Termessos. According to this inscription, in the 2nd century BC, Termessos was at war for unknown reasons with the league of Lycian cities, and again in 189 BC found itself battling its Pisidian neighbour Isinda. At this same time we find the colony of Termessos Minor being founded 85 km in the south-south-west (Oinoanda) in the 2nd century BC. Termessos entered into friendly relations with Attalos II, king of Pergamon, the better to combat its ancient enemy Selge. Attalos II commemorated this friendship by building a two-storied stoa in Termessos.

Termessos was an ally of Rome, and so in 71 BC was granted independent status by the Roman Senate; according to this law its freedom and rights were guaranteed. This independence was maintained continuously for a long time, the only exception being an alliance with Amyntas king of Galatia (reigned 36-25 BC). This independence is documented also by the coins of Termessos, which bear the title ""Autonomous"".

The end of Termessos came when its aqueduct was crushed in an earthquake, destroying the water supply to the city.  The city was abandoned (year unknown), which helps to explain its remarkable state of preservation today.

Site today

Approach

From the main road, a steep road leads up to the city. From this road one can see the famous Yenice pass, through which wound the ancient road that the Termessians called ""King Street"" as well as Hellenistic period fortification walls, cisterns and many other remains. King Street, built in the 2nd century AD by contributions from the people of Termessos, passes through the city walls higher up and stretches in a straight line all the way to the centre of the city. In the walls to the east of the city gate are some extremely interesting inscriptions with augury by dice. Throughout the history of the Roman Empire, beliefs of this sort-in sorcery, magic, and superstition-were widespread. The Termessians were probably very interested in fortune telling. Inscriptions of this kind are usually four to five lines long and include numbers to be thrown with the dice, the name of the god wanted for soothsaying, and the nature of the prediction given in the counsels of that god.

Main square
The city Termessians where the principal official buildings are located lies on a flat area a little beyond the inner walls. The most striking of these structures is the agora, which has very special architectural characteristics. The ground floor of this open-air market place has been raised on stone blocks, and to its north-west five big cisterns have been hollowed out. The agora is surrounded on three sides by stoas. According to the inscription found on the two-storey stoa on the north-west, it was presented to Termessos by Attalos II, king of Pergamum (reigned 150-138 BC) as proof of his friendship. As for the north-eastern stoa, it was built by a wealthy Termessian named Osbaras, probably in imitation of the stoa of Attalos. The ruins lying to the north-east of the agora must belong to the gymnasium, but they are hard to make out among all the trees. The two-storey building consisted of an internal courtyard surrounded by vaulted rooms. The exterior is decorated with niches and other ornamentation of the Doric order. This structure dates from the 1st century AD.

Theatre
Immediately to the east of the agora lies the theatre. Commanding a view out over the Pamphylian plain, this building is no doubt the most eyecatching in all the Termessos plain. It displays most clearly the features of the Roman theatre, which preserved the Hellenistic period theatre plan. The Hellenistic cavea, or semicircular seating area, is divided in two by a diazoma. Above the diazoma rise eight tiers of seats, below it are sixteen, allowing for a seating capacity of some 4-5,000 spectators. A large arched entrance way connects the cavea with the agora. The southern parados was vaulted in Roman times, the northern has been left in its original open-air state. The stage building exhibits features characteristic of the 2nd century AD. A long narrow room is all that lies behind it. This is connected with the podium where the play took place, by five doors piercing the richly ornamented facade or scaenae frons. Under the stage lie five small rooms where wild animals were kept before being taken into the orchestra for combat.

As in other classical cities, an odeon lies about 100 metres from the theatre. This building, which looks like a small theatre, can be dated to the 1st century BC. It is well preserved all the way to roof level and exhibits the finest quality ashlar masonry. The upper storey is ornamented in the Doric order and coursed with square-cut blocks of stone, while the lower storey is unornamented and pierced by two doors. It is certain that the building was originally roofed, since it received its light from eleven large windows in the east and west walls. Just how this roof, which spanned 25 metres, was housed, has not been determined yet. Because the interior is full of earth and rubble at present, it is not possible to gauge either the building's seating arrangement or its capacity. Seating capacity was probably not larger than 600-700. Amid the rubble, pieces of coloured marble have been unearthed, giving rise to the possibility that the interior walls were decorated with mosaic. It is also possible that this elegant building served as the bouleuterion or council chamber.

Temples
Six temples of varying sizes and types have been accounted for at Termessos. Four of these are found near the odeon in an area that must have been sacred. The first of these temples is located directly at the back of the odeon and is constructed of truly splendid masonry. It has been proposed that this was temple of the city's chief god, Zeus Solymeus. What a pity, then, that apart from its five-metre-high cella walls, very little remains of this temple.

The second temple lies near the south-west corner of the odeon. It possesses a 5.50 × 5.50 metre cella and is of the prostylos type. According to an inscription found on the still complete entrance, this temple was dedicated to Artemis, and both the building and the cult statue inside were paid for by a woman named Aurelia Armasta and her husband using their own funds. To the other side of this entrance, a statue of this woman's uncle stands on an inscribed base. The temple can be dated on stylistic grounds to the end of the 2nd century AD.

To the east of the Artemis temple are the remains of a Doric temple. It is of the peripteral type, with six or eleven columns to a side; judging from the size of it, it must have been the largest temple in Termessos. From surviving reliefs and inscriptions, it too, is understood to have been dedicated to Artemis.

Further to the east, the ruins of another smaller temple lie on a rock-hewn terrace. The temple rose on a high podium, but to what god it was dedicated is not known at present. However, contrary to general rules of classical temple architecture, the entrance to this temple lies to the right, indicating that it may have belonged to a demi-god or hero. It can be dated to the beginning of the 3rd century AD.

As for the other two temples, they are located near the stoa of Attalos belong to the Corinthian order, and are of the prostylos type. Also dedicated to deities who are as yet unknown, these temples can be dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD.

Other parts of the city
Of all the official and cult buildings to be found in this broad central area, one of the most interesting is in the form of a typical Roman period house. An inscription can be seen above the Doric order doorway along the west wall, which rises to a height of six metres. In this inscription the owner of the house is praised as the founder of the city. Doubtless, this house was not really that of the founder of Termessos. Maybe it was a little gift awarded the owner for extraordinary service rendered to the city. This type of house generally belonged to nobles and plutocrats. The main entrance gives onto a hall which leads through a second entrance to a central courtyard, or atrium. An impluvium or pool designed to catch rainwater lies in the middle of the courtyard. The atrium held an important place in the daily activities of houses such as this, and was also used as a reception room for guests. As such it was often ostentatiously decorated. The other rooms of the house were arranged around the atrium.

A street with wide, shop-lined porticoes ran north–south through the city. The space between the columns of the porticoes was often filled with statues of successful athletes, most of them wrestlers. The inscribed bases for these statues are still in place, and by reading them we can recreate the ancient splendour of this street.

Cemeteries

To the south, west and north of the city, mostly within the city walls, there are large cemeteries containing rock-cut tombs, one is supposed to have belonged to Alcetas himself. Unfortunately the tomb has been despoiled by treasure hunters. In the tomb itself a kind of lattice work was carved between the columns behind the kline; at the top there was probably an ornamental frieze. The left part of the tomb is decorated with the depiction of a mounted warrior dateable to the 4th century BC. it is known that the youth of Termessos, much affected by the death of General Alcetas, built a magnificent tomb for him, and the historian Diodoros records that Alcetas did battle with Antigonos while mounted on a horse. These coincidences suggest that this is indeed the tomb of Alcetas and that it is he who is depicted in the relief.

The sarcophagi, hidden for centuries among a dense growth of trees south-west of the city, transports one in an instant to the depths of history ceremony, the dead were placed in these sarcophagi along with their clothing, jewellery, and other rich accouterments. The bodies of the poor were buried in simple stone, clay, or wooden sarcophagi. Dateable to the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, these sarcophagi generally rest on a high pedestal. In the family tombs of the wealthy on the other hand, the sarcophagi were placed inside a richly ornamented structure built in the shape of the deceased together with his lineage, or the names of those given permission to be buried alongside him. Thus the right of usage was officially guaranteed. In this manner the history of one specific tomb can be ascertained. In addition, one finds inscriptions calling on the fury of the gods to prevent the sarcophagi from being opened and to scare away grave robbers. The inscriptions also state the fines meted out to those who did not conform to these rules. These fines, ranging from 300 to 100,000 denarii and generally paid to the city treasury in the name of Zeus Solymeus, took the place of legal judgments.

Termessos, after a gradual decline, was finally abandoned in the 5th century. Some of the remains found there are the walls, the Hadrian's triumphal arch, the cisterns, the theater, the gymnasium, the agora, the odeon and the heroon. Among the tombs which are scattered far and wide can be seen those of Alcates, Agatemeros and the Lion decorated sarcophagi, which are extraordinary.

No excavations have as yet been undertaken at Termessos.

96,"Heinz Nixdorf (April 9, 1925 – March 17, 1986) was a German computing pioneer, businessman and founder of Nixdorf Computer AG.

Nixdorf was born in Paderborn, Germany.

The 27-year-old Nixdorf, at the time a physics student, founded his first computer company in 1952. As the owner, he led this company to become an international electronics company with revenues of almost four billion Deutsche Mark at its peak. His microcomputers were competitors to IBM mainframes. Nixdorf is remembered as one of the entrepreneurs who, in the 1950s to 1970s, symbolized the German economic miracle. He was also an ambitious athlete and is remembered for his efforts to provide good education to his employees. He succumbed to a heart attack in 1986 at the CeBIT in Hanover.

Early life
Nixdorf was born on April 9, 1925 as the oldest child of five. He went to a Catholic board school where he first showed his talent for mathematics and science. Due to his father's unemployment during the 1920s and 30s, his childhood was defined by poverty. Achieving good grades in school, he was offered a scholarship to become a teacher. Uninterested in becoming that career, Nixdorf wrote a letter to the Ministry of Education in Berlin. As a result, he was granted permission to attend the Reismann-Gymnasium in Paderborn starting in 1941. In 1942, Nixdorf was drafted by the Wehrmacht and served on the Eastern Front. He completed his education in 1947, receiving the Abitur.

Education
With the aid of a scholarship, Nixdorf studied physics at the Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Universität in Frankfurt am Main in 1947. In addition to his education in physics, he also attended seminars in business economics. In 1951 Nixdorf started working for the development department of Remington Rand Corp. There he gained knowledge of simple adding machines and met Walter Sprick, whose assistant he became. Leaving Remington to work at IBM, Sprick handed some of his work and inventions over to Nixdorf. Based on those concepts, Nixdorf developed the Elektronensaldierer and the Elektronenmultiplizierer.

Founding and development of the company
In 1952 Nixdorf founded the Labor für Impulstechnik in Essen. On September 5, 1952, Nixdorf hired his first employee, an electronics technician named Alfred Wierzioch. In 1954 they released their first vacuum-tube computer, called ES, for the local electric utility company. From this point on the company grew rapidly, becoming a supplier of electronic computing devices to other companies, including Wanderer, at the time the leading German manufacturer of office machines. 

In 1959 the company moved to Paderborn where Nixdorf was born. Utilizing his connections there he had ambitious plans to grow his company. In 1961 his company had 60 employees.
In 1965 the Wanderer Logatronic, an electronic desk calculator, was presented at Hannover Messe. It was the first electronic calculator to use semiconductors, revolutionary for the time. In 1967, Nixdorf developed the Logatronic into the Nixdorf 820 in 1967, which was very successful. In 1968 Nixdorf bought Wanderer and renamed the company Nixdorf Computer AG.

National and international success
The national and international success of the brand started in the 70s. By 1985 the company's revenue was about four billion D-Mark and it employed 24,000 people in 44 countries. Nixdorf died of a heart attack on March 17, 1986 at the CeBIT in Hannover.

Nixdorf as an employer
Nixdorf was invested in the education of his employees, which he promoted with a lot of personal effort and money. In 1969 he founded a trade school on the company premises. Furthermore, he supported the Universität-Gesamthochschule Paderborn. He also enabled his employees to exercise physically, offering sports courses and building the Ahorn-Sportpark in Paderborn in 1984. The sports park was also open to the public, and is still free of charge today.

Nixdorf also played an instrumental role in the building of Paderborn airport, after threatening to move the company to Frankfurt am Main if no adequate infrastructure were provided. The Paderborn Lippstadt Airport was built and was opened in 1971. Its construction cost was 13.7 million D-Mark.

Personal life
Nixdorf married Renate Ring in 1960. The couple had three sons, one of whom, Martin Nixdorf, is the current chairman of the Heinz-Nixdorf-Stiftung and the Stiftung Westfalen.

98,"Pakistan has several official national symbols including a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower as well as several national heroes. The symbols were adopted at various stages in the existence of Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the All India Muslim League on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand for the creation of a separate country for the Muslims of India. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.

Minar-e-Pakistan 

The Lahore Resolution (Qarardad-e-Lahore) (), also known as the Pakistan Resolution, was a formal political statement adopted by the All India Muslim League at the occasion of its three-day general session on 22–24 March 1940 at Minto Park (now Iqbal Park), Lahore. The resolution called for greater Muslim autonomy in British India and has been largely interpreted as a demand for a separate Muslim state. The idea of separate state for Indian Muslims was first suggested by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 and the name of Pakistan was proposed by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in his Pakistan Declaration pamphlet in 1933. Initially, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other leaders were in favour of Hindu-Muslim unity, but the volatile political climate and religious hostilities of the 1930s made the idea more appealing.
In his speech, Jinnah criticised the Indian National Congress and the nationalist Muslims, and espoused the Two-Nation Theory and the reasons for the demand for separate Muslim homelands. Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Chief Minister of the Punjab, drafted the original resolution, but that was not fully acceptable to all the Working Committee, so extensive redrafting followed, by the Subject Committee of the Muslim League. The text is ambiguous in accepting the concept of various Muslim 'zones' within a ""United India"" due to communal concerns and it does not clearly recommend the creation of a separate, fully independent Muslim state. The resolution was moved in the general session by A.K. Fazlul Huq, Chief Minister of Bengal and was supported seconded by several leaders. The principle text of the Lahore Resolution was passed on 24 March 1940. In 1941 it became part of the Muslim League's constitution. By 1946, it formed the basis for the struggle of the Muslim League for a separate Muslim state. The statement declared:

The Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: ; Mīnār-ĕ Pākistān) or Tower of Pakistan is a 60 metre tall concrete minaret in Iqbal Park in Lahore. The Minar was built on the site where the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding the creation of Pakistan. Pakistan now celebrates this day as a national holiday each year under the name of Pakistan Day which is also the day in 1956 when the country became the first Islamic Republic in the world. It was designed by Muhammad Wali Ullah Khan and built by Mian Abdul Khaliq Company. The base of the tower is raised about 4 metres from the ground. The next 13 metres form a sculpted, flower-like base and from this point, the Minar tapers as it rises. The base platform is shaped like a five-pointed star and it encloses crescent-shaped pools. It is constructed of reinforced concrete, with the floors and walls rendered in stone and marble.

National flag 

The national flag was designed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and was based on the original flag of the Muslim League. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 11 August 1947, just days before independence. The flag is referred to in the national anthem as Parcham-e-Sitāra-o-Hilāl in Urdu (lit. Flag of the Crescent and Star). The flag comprises a dark green field, representing the Muslim majority of Pakistan, with a vertical white stripe in the hoist, representing religious minorities. In the centre is a white crescent moon, representing progress, and a white five-pointed star, representing light and knowledge. The flag symbolizes Pakistan's commitment to Islam, the Islamic world and the rights of religious minorities. The flag is flown on several important days of the year including Republic Day and Independence Day. The flag is also flown on the residences and motor vehicles of many public officials including the President and the Prime Minister.

National anthem 

The national anthem of Pakistan or Qaumī Tarāna (Urdu: ), is played during any event involving the hoisting of the flag, for example Republic Day (23 March) and Independence Day (14 August). The Constituent Assembly had not adopted a national anthem by the time Pakistan became independent, so when the flag was hoisted at the independence ceremony it was accompanied by the song, ""Pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Paendabad"". Muhammad Ali Jinnah asked a Lahore-based Hindu writer, Jagan Nath Azad, to write a national anthem for Pakistan. Jinnah may have done this to promote a more secular idealism for Pakistan. The anthem written by Azad was quickly approved by Jinnah, and it was played on Radio Pakistan. Azad's work remained as Pakistan's national anthem for about eighteen months.

A National Anthem Committee was formed in 1948, but it had difficulty finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the Shah of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on 10 August 1950 and was approved for playing during the visit of the Shah. However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954 followed by a performance of the national anthem in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.

State emblem 

The State Emblem was adopted in 1954 and symbolizes Pakistan's ideological foundation, the basis of its economy, its cultural heritage and its guiding principles. The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above a shield, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll. The crest and the green colour of the emblem are traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and signify the agricultural base of the economy. The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, represents the floral designs used in traditional Mughal art and emphasizes the cultural heritage of Pakistan.

Motto 

The scroll supporting the shield contains Muhammad Ali Jinnah's motto in Urdu, which reads from right to left: () ""Iman, Ittehad, Nazm o Zabt"" translated as ""Faith, Unity, Discipline"" and are intended as the guiding principles for Pakistan.

102,"Mae Sariang (, ) is a small town and district (amphoe) on the narrow valley along Yuam River in Mae Hong Son province, northern Thailand, along the Myanmar border. The areas around Mae Sariang are mountainous and forested; flat terrain that suits population or agriculture is scarce. The local population of Mae Sariang is of mixed origin. The main ethnicity in the low land plain, town center and its satellite villages along the river is Tai Yuan (Northern Thai or Lanna people) with some cross-marriage with other ethnicities. There are also Tai Yai or Shan people in the town center; they are among the first groups that inhabited the area. Red Karen and Karen descendants also reside in the town with a high density in the Christian quarter of the town. There is a sizable Bengali Muslim community and a mosque near the central market. The area has many links to Burma, such as its architecture and a large population of Burmese Muslims. Mae Sariang represents the westernmost area where Lanna culture and architecture dominated which also well assimilated with Burmese/ Shan.

Geography
Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise): Mae La Noi of Mae Hong Son Province; Mae Chaem and Hot of Chiang Mai province; Sop Moei of Mae Hong Son province; and Kayin State and Kayah State of Myanmar.

Salawin National Park is in the district. The important river of Mae Sariang is the Yuam River.

Climate

History
In 1900 the administration in the area was formalized as a district under Mae Hong Son. Originally the district was named Mueang Yuam (เมืองยวม), which was changed in 1917 to Mae Sariang.

Administration

The district is divided into seven sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 77 villages (mubans). Mae Sariang is also a sub-district municipality (thesaban tambon) which covers parts of tambons Ban Kat and Mae Sariang. There are a further seven tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

Number 7 is not used.

103,"Hirsi Magan Isse (, ; 1935 — 2008), commonly known as Hirsi Magan, was a scholar and a leading figure of the Somali revolution. Part of Somalia's political elite, he was a leader in the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), one of the earliest and most influential factions in the Somali Civil War that broke out in 1991.

Magan Isse was a comrade-in-arms of erstwhile President of Somalia, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and the father of the former Dutch MP and critic of Islam, Ayaan Hirsi Ali

Personal life
Magan Isse was born in Somalia in 1935 as one of the nine children of Magan Isse Guleid (1845–1945). He was a devout Muslim and student of Somali culture.

Magan Isse married eight times and had nineteen daughters and thirteen sons. He had two daughters with his first wife. His second marriage produced son Mahad, daughter Ayaan, and daughter Haweya. Haweya died in 1998. He also had a daughter in his third marriage. He later remarried his first wife, who he had divorced shortly after he married his second wife.

Magan Isse studied in Italy and in the United States at Columbia University, New York, where he obtained a degree in anthropology. As a trained linguist and anthropologist, he is known as a champion of Osmanya, the Somali writing script invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, unlike the former head of state, Siad Barre, who made Shire Jama Ahmed's modified Latin script the national standard in Somalia in 1973

Political and military career
After the assassination of president Abdirashid Ali Shermarke and Siad Barre coming to power in October, 1969, Magan Isse was considered dangerous to the new leadership and was imprisoned from 1972 to October 1975.

In 1976, Magan Isse escaped from prison and fled from Somalia to Saudi Arabia. Barre banned all political parties with the exception of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSF) the same year and the SODAF (a forerunner of the SSDF) was founded in exile in Rome. The following year, Magan Isse moved to Ethiopia, where he witnessed the year-long Ogaden War. It was also the period of the Red Terror of the Derg, and its victims included the Western Somali Liberation Front, an Ogaden-based Somali rebel outfit. For security purposes, Magan Isse opted to relocate his family to a suburb in Nairobi, while he continued to live in Somalia and Ethiopia most of the time.

In the summer of 1982, the SSDF played a key role in the second armed conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia. The SSDF, supported by the Derg leader Mengistu's air force, waged a low intensity guerrilla war against the Somali army. Magan Isse became a well-known figure in Somalia at the time as director and presenter of Radio Kulmis (meaning ""Unity"" in Somali), which aired anti-Barré programs from Addis Abeba, Ethiopia).

In 1988, Magan Isse and Mohamed Haji Aden headed an insurrection near Eyl in the Nugaal region, part of Puntland, mainly inhabited by Majeerteen of the Issa Mahamoud sub-clans. This insurrection of the SSDF, which started in the southern part of Nugaal and Bari and the western part of Mudug, eventually led to the autonomy of the province of Puntland in 1998. In the 1990s the SSDF switched sides from the SNM of Somaliland to its former adversary, Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, former minister of defense of the government of Siad Barré. After the fall of Barré, he was the head of the Somali National Front (SNF). With the SNF the SSDF tried in vain to capture the region around Kismayo.

Later years
Magan Isse spent the better part of his later years in political exile in London, United Kingdom. He died in 2008 at 73 years of age.

105,"Plain weave (also called tabby weave, linen weave or taffeta weave) is the most basic of three fundamental types of textile weaves (along with satin weave and twill). It is strong and hard-wearing, and is used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.

In plain weave cloth, the warp and weft threads cross at right angles, aligned so they form a simple criss-cross pattern. Each weft thread crosses the warp threads by going over one, then under the next, and so on. The next weft thread goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa. 
 
Balanced plain weaves are fabrics in which the warp and weft are made of threads of the same weight (size) and the same number of ends per inch as picks per inch.
Basketweave is a variation of plain weave in which two or more threads are bundled and then woven as one in the warp or weft, or both.

A balanced plain weave can be identified by its checkerboard-like appearance. It is also known as one-up-one-down weave or over and under pattern.

Examples of fabric with plain weave are chiffon, organza, percale and taffeta.

Etymology 

According to the 12th-century geographer al-Idrīsī, the city of Almería in Andalusia manufactured imitations of Iraqi and Persian silks called ‘attābī, which David Jacoby identifies as ""a taffeta fabric made of silk and cotton (natural fibers) originally produced in Attabiya, a district of Baghdad."" The word was adopted into Medieval Latin as attabi, then French as tabis and English as tabby, as in ""tabby weave"".

End uses 
Its uses range from heavy and coarse canvas and blankets made of thick yarns to the lightest and finest cambries and muslins made in extremely fine yarns. Chiffon, organza, percale and taffeta are also plain weave fabrics.

106,"Bagurumba () is a folk dance of indigenous Bodo tribe in Assam and Northeast India. It  is a traditional dance which is traditionally inherent to one generation to another generations.  The Bodo women perform the Bagurumba dance with their colourful dokhna, jwmgra (fasra) and aronai. The Bagurumba dance is accepted as main traditional dance of Bodo people. But there are some other important dances like Bardwisikhla dance, Mwsaglangnai dance, Dahal-tungri sibnai dance, Sikri sikla dance, Daosri delai dance, Sa-gwlao mwsanai, Kopri sibnai mwsanai and so on. All these dances are known as Kristi dance. It is also accompanied by musical instruments like kham (a long drum, made of wood and goat skin or other animal’s skin), sifung (flute, made of bamboo), jota (made of iron/tama), serja (a bowed instrument, made of wood and animals skin), and gongwna (made of bamboo), tharkha (a piece of split bamboo).

This Bagurumba dance is originated from nature. Some thousands of years ago it was practiced by the Boro people. Generally Boro people like to stay in a green environment. They love to play with the environment, beauty of nature. So they used to stay in the foothills of the eastern and southern Himalayas, which are generally forest area.  There are so many different symbols in this traditional dance, which are imitated from other natural environment.  Like – dance of plants, dance of animals, birds, butterfly dance, wave of flowing river, wind etc.

By seeing this bagurumba dance, all Boro people can’t stay calm and quiet. By seeing this dance, suddenly every Bodo people use to dance unknowingly, and they feel peace and happiness in their mind.

There are no certain days and times to perform this dance; this dance can be performed on any occasion, festival and programme. At present Bagurumba dance is famous over the whole world.
“Jath nongabwla
Cool nongabwla
tabwrwm homnanwi-
bamnanwi lagwomwnka
hai lwgw lagwomwnka”
these lines indicate that, if we are not really jath and khul, they might be taken us whenever they want, but we are very much jath and cool so nobody can catch or carry us- it’s a confidential song of Boro women. They thought that, lose character’s women goes to bad practices and if someone comes to catch her, she never protects or restrict them. So we are not that type of women, we are jath and cool.“Turi barinilai daosen
jwngni lagwalwi dajen”(kobam gwrwbhwnai) the meaning of this line is- we should not lose / no failure. We must won any games always. It’s a confidential song of boro women.

Musical instruments

Among many different musical instruments, the Bodos use for Bagurumba Dance:

Sifung: This is a long bamboo flute having five holes rather than six as the north Indian Bansuri would have and is also much longer than it, producing a much lower tone.

 Serja: a violin-like instrument. It has a round body and the scroll is bent forward.
 kham : a long drum made of wood and goat skin.
 Jota: made of iron/tama.
 Gongwna: made of bamboo.

Composition
Bagurumba uses F Major Pentatonic Scale, exactly similar to Chinese Traditional Music, an indication of the ancient Chinese influence.

108,"John Donkin Dormand, Baron Dormand of Easington (27 August 1919 – 18 December 2003) was a British educationist and Labour Party politician from the coal mining area of Easington in County Durham, in the north-east of England. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Easington constituency from 1970 until his retirement in 1987.

Described as an ""old-style centre-right socialist"", Dormand was a working-class child who progressed through grammar school education to study at Oxford and Harvard to a career as an educational administrator before entering Parliament at the age of 50, where he was noted as an advocate for education and for mining areas. He never achieved ministerial office, but as a skilled administrator he played a significant role as a government whip in the 1970s, and as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party when the party was in opposition in the 1980s. An atheist and a staunch republican, he reluctantly accepted a life peerage when he retired from the House of Commons and was an active working peer until his death 16 years later.

Early life 
Dormand was born near Easington at the workingmen's club in the village of Haswell, when his father Bernard, a former miner, was steward. He was educated locally at Wellfield Grammar School. Although he later took up rugby, he was a skilled footballer in his youth, good enough to have professional trials with both Manchester United and Charlton Athletic. Sport remained a major part of his life; until his death he remained a member of Houghton-le-Spring Rugby Club and of Burnmoor Cricket Club, last playing both games at the age of 63.

After training as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because teaching was a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship to Harvard in his second year (1954), becoming a friend of the future Senator Ted Kennedy.

From 1940 to 1948 Dormand worked as a teacher in the coal mining community of Easington, teaching at Hordern Modern School and his old school, now renamed Wellfield A.J. Dawson Grammar School. In 1948, he gave up teaching to become an education advisor to Durham County Council, and in 1957 moved to be adviser to the National Coal Board. He stayed with the NCB for only two years before returning to Durham to be Further Education organiser; from 1963 to 1970 he was Director of Education for Easington Rural District Council. He was also the President of the Easington branch of the National Union of Teachers.

Political career 
Dormand had been a member of the Labour Party since the age of 18. He was elected to Haswell parish council at the age of 26, and at 30 to Easington rural district council.

Manny Shinwell, the then 85-year-old veteran Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the Easington constituency, announced in 1969 that he would not contest the next general election. Dormand, who had been secretary of the Easington Constituency Labour Party throughout the 1960s and Shinwell's presumed successor, was selected as the new Labour candidate to contest the ultra-safe seat (Shinwell had been re-elected in 1966 with over 80% of the votes). At the 1970 general election in which Harold Wilson's Labour government was defeated, Dormand was returned to the House of Commons with a barely reduced 79.8% share of the vote.

Education 
His maiden speech on 8 July 1970 focused on education and on the needs of Durham as an ""excepted district"", and in particular on those classed as ""slow learners"". It was well received, and the then Secretary of State for Education Margaret Thatcher was seen to be making notes. Dormand's views on education were supportive of comprehensive education, and in July 1973 he urged the abolition of private schools (attacking particularly those Labour MPs who sent their children to be educated privately).

Dormand opposed Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), and at the time of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.

Republicanism 
Dormand later described himself as ""a republican for as long as I can remember having an interest in politics"" and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out in opposition to the monarchy, declaring in 1971 that ""the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow"". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for ""scores of miners"" to be honoured as they were just as worthy.

Government whip 
Labour was returned to government at the February 1974 general election, and Dormand was appointed as an assistant government whip under Bob Mellish. He was promoted to be a Lord of the Treasury (full Government whip) in a reshuffle after the October election.

The post of a Whip normally required silence in the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand was involved in a difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.

When James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as Prime Minister in 1976, Mellish resigned and was replaced by Michael Cocks, and Dormand was promoted within the Whip's office to be the pairing whip, a job which involved co-ordinating agreed absences by MPs from one party with those of another so that the outcome of parliamentary votes is not affected. The Home Secretary Merlyn Rees had urged Callaghan to appoint Dormand as Chief Whip rather than Michael Cocks.

The role of the pairing whip remained a crucial one as the government's slim majority turned to a minority through defeats at by-elections, and Dormand was credited with a central role in helping the government stay in office, telling Wilson that he was too ""bloody knackered at the end of the day"" to record the events surrounding the late-night votes. In January 1978 Dormand was named in a report by the Serjeant-at-Arms as having assisted in blocking one of the Division lobbies in an attempt to prevent a vote on part of the Government's legislation to devolve power to Scotland.

On free votes he did not always help the Government. In July 1977, Dormand voted against the European Assembly Elections Bill which brought in direct elections to the European Parliament.

In opposition 
When Labour lost the 1979 general election, Dormand served for two years as an opposition whip. He was an active opposition frontbencher who was particularly vocal in criticising the effects of the Thatcher government's economic policy on the manufacturing industry of the Northern region: in June 1980 he said that the policies were ""crucifying"" the region and it was ""becoming a scene of devastation"". He specifically called on Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe to abandon monetarism.

Parliamentary Labour Party chair 
In the 1970s, Dormand had opposed left-wing infiltration into the Labour Party, and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO at a time when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the vacant position of Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister James Callaghan) defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew. The other three candidates were Harry Ewing (22 votes), Willie Hamilton (11 votes) and Frank Hooley (11 votes) but all withdrew so no second ballot was held. Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987.

Dormand had a difficult job in trying to unite a fractious Parliamentary party at a time when the Labour Party was growing unpopular. In November 1982, amidst rumours that a majority of Labour MPs wanted to replace party leader Michael Foot, Dormand gave a radio interview insisting that ""I have absolutely no doubt whatever that the vast majority think that Michael Foot is the man for the job at the moment, and will take us into the next general election"". In response, Foot's critics noted Dormand's use of the words ""at the moment"".

Kingmaker for the Speaker 
After the 1983 general election, Dormand played a key role in the accession to the Speakership of Bernard Weatherill, seconding his nomination for the post. Weatherill had been an opposition whip when Dormand had been working in the Government whip's office in the late 1970s, but had not been appointed to the Thatcher government; in supporting him, Dormand pointed out to Labour cheers that Weatherill ""is his own man"" and would ""ensure that the rights of backbenchers were safeguarded"". In July 1983 he worked with his Conservative opposite number Edward du Cann (Chairman of the 1922 Committee) to agree an increase in MPs' pay over that which the Government proposed.

Like most Labour MPs, Dormand opposed the decision of National Union of Mineworkers president Arthur Scargill to call a national strike in 1984 to 1985, but he supported the miners in the Durham coalfield when his local Easington Colliery and others joined the strike. He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of washing her hands of the dispute like ""Pontius Pilate"".

Despite his age, he remained physically active. In the 1970s he had campaigned successfully for the establishment of a parliamentary gym, continued playing cricket and rugby until the age of 63, and cycled from the House of Commons to his flat near Millbank. The then Leader of the House of Commons, John Biffen, recounted how Dormand would ""swathe himself in luminous strips"" before setting off, and although he abandoned the bicycle in 1987, deterred by London's heavy traffic, he took up walking instead.

House of Lords 
Labour leader Neil Kinnock was expected to ask him to be government chief whip if Labour won the 1987 general election, but Dormand thought it right to retire at the age of 67. His successor John Cummings was the first miner to become MP for the area.

A staunch republican who deplored all forms of social privilege, including hereditary peerages, he accepted Kinnock's offer of a seat in the House of Lords with some reluctance, receiving a life peerage as Baron Dormand of Easington, of Easington in the County of Durham on 13 October 1987.

However, once in the Lords he thrived, serving on numerous select committees, including education, trade and industry, and the liaison and procedure committees. He was also appointed as deputy chairman of the Teesside Development Corporation, whose  of de-industrialised land included part of his former constituency. The corporation was later condemned by Labour MP Ashok Kumar for having left a legacy of limited and ""often inappropriate and threadbare development"".

His areas of expertise included the film industry and tourism, continuing the work he had begun in the Commons as chair of the all-party parliamentary tourism committee in seeking the promotion of tourism in previously overlooked parts of the United Kingdom. He was also a member of the select committee on committee structure of the House of Lords and its chairman at the end of 1991, and later became Labour Peer's Representative on the Shadow Cabinet.

Dormand had been brought up a Christian, an allegiance which continued into adulthood, when he sat on the parochial church council. He described his adoption of atheism as the result of ""some years of very considerable thought"", and once freed from the fear of offending religious constituents, his atheism became more outspoken in the Lords; in July 2000 he called for the disestablishment of the Church of England. He helped form the All Party Humanist Group, and became vice-president of the British Humanist Association. As a former teacher, he sought parity in schools for religions and humanism, seeking to have both described neutrally rather than propagated. After his death, Michael Turnbull, the former Bishop of Durham, wrote in The Times of how Dormand had pursued this and other causes ""without prejudice"" and with ""a warm affection for others"".

He continued to live in Easington after leaving the Commons, but moved in 1991 to Clipsham, Rutland, to be closer to the House of Lords. He described the move as ""traumatic"", but remained active in the Lords until his death, pursuing his interests in education and continuing his opposition to the monarchy. Of some 20 Labour peers opposed to the monarchy, Dormand was the most outspoken, asking the government in November 2001 ""whether they will call a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy"" (the Lord Chancellor's answer was ""No, my Lords""), and asked in March 2003 for a Select Committee to consider the future of the Monarchy.

He recovered from a double heart bypass in 2001, and received an honorary doctorate of letters in July 2003 from Loughborough University. His last contribution to the House of Lords debates was on 19 November 2003, when he criticised the situation of ""having to borrow money from the state to undertake a degree course"" as ""a considerable deterrent to poorer families"". The following week he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Sunderland, taking the opportunity to repeat his criticism of funding for students by saying ""it is very important that young people should not be prevented from going to university"".

That was Dormand's last visit to his native North-East. He went into hospital in Peterborough four days later, and died on 18 December 2003, aged 84. Tony Blair described him as ""a life-long servant of the Labour Party""; When asked by a journalist to choose his own epitaph, the answer had been ""he was a canny lad."" A care home in Peterlee is named after him.

Family 
In 1963, Dormand married Doris Robinson (née Pearson), a former teacher who survived him. He had one stepson, and one stepdaughter from Doris's previous marriage.

Toponymy
The area was settled heavily from 1870 to 1880 by colonizers from the United Kingdom and the United States. As such, it was known until 1959 as the united counties of Spaulding and Ditchfield (cantons unis de Spaulding-et-Ditchfield). The municipality was renamed in honour of Louis de Buade de Frontenac, a governor general of New France who played a significant role in the development of the colony.

110,"Mark Robert Riddell (born 9 December 1980) is an Australian rugby league commentator and former professional player who played as a  in the 2000s and 2010s. A City New South Wales representative goal-kicker, he played in the NRL for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Parramatta Eels and the Sydney Roosters, and in the Super League with the Wigan Warriors.

St George Illawarra Dragons
Riddell eventually made the transition into first grade while playing with his new club side at St George, making his début against local rivals the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks during round one of the 2001 season. During the season he became a regular goal-kicker for the club where he developed a distinctive 'raised arm' motion before he would take the kick. Fans in the crowd would mimic this action. Riddell had an impressive début season in first grade with St. George Illawarra finishing the season as the club's top scorer with 130 points  and cemented his position in the side as hooker.

During his second season with St. George Illawarra, Riddell would again have a good season not only impressing club staff and fans with his quickly evolving running game from dummy half, goal kicking and strength close to the try line ultimately earning himself a call up to the 2002 international Australian Kangaroos 'train-on' squad but was not selected in the final touring side. He finished the season again as the club's top scorer with 129 points to his name even though he was sidelined during several games in the season through suspension after being sent off twice during the regular season.

At the start of the 2003 NRL season, Riddell was criticised amongst some media circles for being slow, out of shape and overweight along with negative talk about discipline problems, however nothing eventuated and he went on to play all twenty-four games of the regular season again finishing as the club's top point scorer with an individual record high of 166 points. In the final round, the injury-ravaged St. George club upset the finals-bound Brisbane Broncos 26-25 with Riddell scoring 18 points of his own, including a last-minute pressure penalty goal 41 metres out from the try line and 10 metres in from touch. This was the two points that won the Dragons the game after having fallen behind through a Darren Lockyer field goal five minutes beforehand.

2004 was again another season of consistent performances for Riddell and several media pundits began speculating on his chances of representing New South Wales in the annual State of Origin, however he was left out of the side but still tasted his first representative experience playing for the City origin side in the annual City vs Country Origin fixture. Salary cap restraints on the club at the conclusion of the season along with several lucrative offers eventuated in a move from the Dragons. Riddell signed with the Parramatta Eels for the 2005 NRL season.

He left St. George Illawarra as the club's highest ever point scorer.

Parramatta Eels
Riddell began the 2005 NRL season with the Parramatta Eels in his regular role of hooker. He had his worst season in regards to point scoring after having to share the goal kicking duties with team mate Luke Burt, finishing the season with only 50 points  but ultimately helping his side to the Minor Premiership.

Riddell was in the Parramatta side which made it to the preliminary final as favorites against North Queensland Cowboys.  In a game that they were expected to win, Parramatta were beaten 29-0 in one of the biggest upsets of the season.  In 2017, Riddell spoke of the disappointment to miss out on qualifying for the grand final in 2005 by saying ""The worst thing was that we had watched St George lose to Wests Tigers the night before and we had comfortably beat Wests twice that year and thought we were morals for the premiership"".

On 17 May 2006, Riddell was dropped from the Parramatta first grade side and fined a total of $5,000 for failing to show up to a recovery session on a Monday morning following a regular season fixture, he later admitted the reason he had failed to show up to the session was because he was intoxicated. His axing, along with that of Tim Smith's, was the first piece of action taken by Jason Taylor who just moments earlier was appointed caretaker coach following long-serving coach Brian Smith's dismissal.

In the 2007 NRL season, Riddell made 23 appearances for Parramatta as the club made the preliminary final but fell short of a grand final appearance losing to Melbourne 26-10.

Riddell stayed with at Parramatta through the 2008 NRL season, playing a total of 86 games for Parramatta.

Wigan Warriors

Riddell signed a three-year deal with the Wigan Warriors starting from 2009.

Riddell played for Wigan for two years of his three-year contract. In 2010, Riddell was part of the Warriors side that won the League Leaders' Shield.

He played in the 2010 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford, adding his name to the Grand Final score sheet by successfully kicking a penalty goal.

After the 2010 season, Riddell was released from the last year of his contract so that he could return to Australia to tend to his ill mother.

Sydney Roosters
After his release from Wigan in 2010, Riddell made his return to NRL for the 2011 season, this time with the Sydney Roosters, the club he had represented at a junior level in the SG Ball and Presidents Cup competitions. Riddell was poised to sign with the Wests Tigers, however Tigers coach Tim Sheens made it clear that Riddell was unlikely to get much game time with the first grade side, barring injury, rep duties or suspension of star hooker Robbie Farah.

111,"The New York State Comptroller is an elected constitutional officer of the U.S. state of New York and head of the New York state government's Department of Audit and Control. The New York State Comptroller is the highest-paid state auditor or treasurer in the country. Sixty-one individuals have held the office of State Comptroller since statehood. The incumbent is Thomas DiNapoli, a Democrat.

Powers and duties
The State Comptroller is in effect New York's chief fiscal officer. Article V, Section 1, of the New York Constitution requires the State Comptroller ""to audit all vouchers before payment and all official accounts"", ""to audit the accrual and collection of all revenues and receipts"", and ""to prescribe such methods of accounting as are necessary for the performance of the foregoing duties"". Furthermore, the State Constitution vests the safekeeping and protection of all state funds in the State Comptroller, stating: ""[t]he payment of any money of the state, or of any money under its control, or the refund of any money paid to the state, except upon audit by the comptroller, shall be void..."" In accordance with this constitutional framework, the State Comptroller has broad superintending authority unlike any other state auditor or treasurer in the nation to ensure that state agencies and local governments alike use taxpayer money effectively and efficiently to promote the common good. For example, the State Comptroller:
Serves as sole trustee of the $258.1 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund (value as of March 31, 2021), making the State Comptroller and his or her Department of Audit and Control one of the largest institutional investors in the world;
Administers the New York State and Local Retirement System for public employees, with more than one million members, retirees and beneficiaries and more than 3,000 employers;
Prescribes and maintains the state's accounting system and administers the State’s approximately $16.7 billion payroll;
Reports on the condition of the state's finances;
Manages and issues the state debt;
Reviews state contracts and audits payments to vendors;
Conducts financial, compliance, and performance audits of local governments, state agencies, and public benefit corporations;
Oversees the fiscal affairs of local governments, including New York City, and prescribes uniform systems of accounts, budgets, and financial reports therefor;
Investigates waste, fraud, and abuse of public resources;
Stewards the Justice Court Fund and the Oil Spill Fund;
Functions as custodian of more than $17 billion in unclaimed funds, restoring lost accounts to their rightful owners; and
Holds training conferences and provides technical assistance to improve state and local government operations.

History
In 1776, the New York Provincial Congress appointed an Auditor-General to settle the public accounts. After his resignation, the Council of Appointment appointed an Auditor to succeed. In 1797, the office of the State Comptroller was created by the State Legislature to succeed the State Auditor. The Comptroller was appointed by the Council of Appointment to a one-year term, and could be re-appointed without term limit. In 1800, the Legislature reduced the salary of the Comptroller from $3,000 to $2,500, and Samuel Jones declined to be re-appointed.

Under the Constitution of 1821, the Comptroller was elected by joint ballot of the New York State Legislature to a three-year term. Under the Constitution of 1846, the office became elective by general election, and the Comptroller was elected with the other state cabinet officers in odd years to a two-year term, serving in the second year of the governor in office and the first year of the succeeding governor. The comptroller was elected in 1895 to a three-year term, and subsequently the state officers were elected in even years and served a two-year term concurrently with the governor. In 1926, the responsibilities of the New York State Treasurer were transferred to the Comptroller as the head of the Department of Audit and Control. Since 1938, the comptroller has been elected to a four-year term, like the governor.

113,"Hugh (; 953/4 – 21 December 1001), called the Great, was the Margrave of Tuscany from 969 until his death, and the Duke of Spoleto and Margrave of Camerino from 989 to 996 (as ""Hugh II""). He restored the state apparatus in Tuscany after decades of neglect by margraves whose main interests lay elsewhere. Hugh supported the new Ottonian dynasty (in Italy since 961), and was praised for his justice by the contemporary theologian Peter Damian in his De principis officio (On the Office of a Prince).

Hugh was the son and successor of Hubert, an illegitimate son of King Hugh. His mother was Willa, a daughter of Boniface I, Duke of Spoleto and Margrave of Camerino. The Tuscany that Hugh inherited was not yet characterised by incastellamento (except in the diocese of Lucca) and royal intervention was rare. It was also larger in area than it had been under the last margrave unaffiliated with the royal family, Adalbert II (died 915). The march was defined less by geography than by the public institutions controlled by the margrave. Hugh had his own tribunals, mints and army, and the lands he distributed to the church in his march was mostly public land.

The basis of Hugh's power was the wealthy cities of the Arno valley, although he also possessed extensive landed properties. Towards the end of his life he increasingly dissipated marchesal (public) lands on the foundation of monasteries. The increase in gift-giving to monasteries by Hugh and his vassals (fideles) has been linked to a ""spiritual revival"". Hugh gave lands around Arezzo to the Guidi clan, a family he patronised. He also gave some to the churches of the city, acts confirmed later by the emperors Otto III and Henry II. Hugh supported Otto III in his ecclesiastical reforms and against Venice, to whose duke, Pietro IV Candiano, he was related.

In 996, Otto placed the eight Adriatic counties disputed between him and the papacy under the joint control of Hugh and Margrave Conrad of Ivrea, also Duke of Spoleto and Camerino, although he also left a missus to oversee the courts and finances. In a letter dated 5 August 996 Otto tells Pope Gregory V that ""we are leaving the foremost men of Italy as aid and comfort to you—Hugh of Tuscany, faithful to us in everything, and Conrad..."", and goes on to assure him he would receive ""the works and services due"" him in the disputed territory.

Hugh took an interest in the affairs of Bobbio, a monastery in disarray, and a correspondence with its abbot in self-imposed exile, Gerbert of Aurillac. Hugh seems also to have been on familiar terms with abbot Guarin of Cuxà. Gerbert wrote Hugh a letter dated 1 August 896. Hugh and Conrad of Ivrea apparently requested the Empress Theophanu to come to Italy to set matters straight at Bobbio. When Gerbert later became pope as Sylvester II, he summoned a synod at Rome on 13 January 1001, at which Hugh was present along with Duke of Bavaria, the future Henry II.

In 992, Aloara, the widow of Pandulf Ironhead, who had been regent of the Principality of Capua since her husband's death, died. A revolt broke out at Capua, which under Pandulf had recognised imperial authority, and Prince Landenulf II was assassinated. Hugh, whose job it was as ruler of Spoleto to maintain the link between the south Italian principalities and the empire, intervened to place Pandulf's youngest son, Laidulf on the Capuan throne and quell the revolt.

Upon Hugh's death at Pistoia in 1001, his state collapsed. In 1004 war broke out between Lucca and Pisa. The power of the House of Canossa, margraves from 1027 until 1115, barely extended beyond their own lands, and they did not control the cities. Hugh left no children by his wife Judith. He was buried in the Badia Fiorentina, which his mother had founded in 978, where a monument was later added by Mino da Fiesole.

Hugh is still commemorated annually by the monks on 21 December, the feast of Saint Thomas. Hugh's life became surrounded by legends and he was remembered by Placido Puccinelli in the 17th century as a moral and pious prince. His tomb was said to be the site of celestial visions. The Tuscan poet Dante Alighieri, in Paradiso XVI, 127–30, calls Hugh a ""great baron"":

114,"Colico (Comasco:   or  ; ) is a city in the province of Lecco, Lombardy, Italy. It is situated on the northern arm of Lake Como, where the river Adda enters the lake. Colico is the most important city in the northern part of Lake Como, which is often identified as its Colico branch.

Colico is a local transport hub, with boats to Como and Lecco, as well as trains and roads to Milan (via the eastern shore of the lake, Lecco and Brianza), to Chiavenna, and eastwards to Bolzano, via Passo dello Stelvio.

The Piona Abbey is located in the communal territory, in the Olgiasca peninsula.

Geography 

Colico is dominated by Monte Legnone, at  above sea level, and high foothills. Near Colico is an important natural reserve, the migration corridor of the Pian di Spagna (in the province of Como). The two main waterways of Colico are Inganna and Perlino; the river Adda is a natural boundary between the provinces of Como and Lecco.

Main sights

Forts
Fort Montecchio, a fort built during World War I
Fort Fuentes, a fort built by the Spanish governor of Milan in the early 17th century

Towers 
The whole area was fortified during the Middle Ages, before the construction of the Fort Fuentes. On the northern Montecchio hill are still visible two guard towers, which formed the so-called Castle Colico, built in the Medieval commune period to control the road from Valtellina. The most important from a strategic point of view was Fontanedo Tower, part of a more complex work of fortification built during the 14th century by Visconti. From the tower it was possible to dominate the Upper Lake, the hinterland of Colico and the area of the Lake Mezzola.
In defense of the ancient road linking Lake Como with Valtellina, within the territory of Curcio, there is another lookout tower, now transformed into a farm house and called the Curcio tower.

Another part of the defense system is Fortino d'Adda, or Stallone, located out of the border municipalities in the territory of Gera Lario. Its unique structure has slots for the shot of a firearm and a brick bridge that connects the main entrance to the plain. It is currently used for storage. Another fort is placed in the territory of Olgiasca. It is a casaforte (""stronghouse"", or fortified house), which from the top of the hill controls the town below. It is known as the Castle of Mirabello and it is thought to have been built in the first half of the 16th century.

Roccoli 
Roccoli, or bird snares, are tree architectures, equipped with nets placed vertically, which surround a sort of stone tower from which the hunting was run. They have long been formidable weapons to catch birds which, at the approaching of winter, migrate southwards. This activity was economically important for Colico, placed on the route of the flocks. Of the many bird snares active until about forty years ago, are still well preserved those located near Piona and along the road that goes up to the Fort Fuentes.

Religious buildings 
Piona Abbey, located in the Olgiasca peninsula, and home to a Romanesque church built in the mid-11th century, and later enlarged. 
The small Romanesque church of San Rocco, originally dedicated to the Saints Fabian and Sebastian, located outside the town on the slopes of Monte Legnone, almost midway between the streams of Inganna and Perlino, at a height of five hundred meters.  
Traces of painting, particularly in the apse, are due to an unknown painter from the early 15th century. They include the Christ Pantocrator, flanked by the prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah. A restoration campaign held in recent years discovered an interesting fresco depicting the Last Supper.

Villas 
Villa Malpensata, located in an isolated position on the lake shore, facing the lake near Olgiasca. It is a   19th-century building, which incorporates an older structure.
Villa Osio,  located at the end of Via Lungolario Polti and forms the boundary to the shore. It is currently privately owned.

Culture

Media 

The main newspapers are the provincial ones: La Gazzetta di Lecco or La Provincia di Lecco; ""Teleunica"" is the main local TV of the province.

Events 
The most important event taking place in Colico is the Italian stage of the World Cup of kitesurfing. A classical music festival, Musica sull'Acqua (Water Music), takes place in Piazza Garibaldi and at the Abbey of Piona. The feast of San Rocco is celebrated on 16 August in the homonymous church.

Human geography 
Colico is formed by a centre and several frazioni.

Centre 
The centre is situated between Piazza Garibaldi, Via Vitali, Largo San Giorgio and Via Pontile. This district contains the main services of Colico. Between Via Municipio and Piazza Alpini are the City Hall, the library, the church of Saint George and the main schools. The post office is in Via Villatico.

This district has a long beach, a field of soccer, tennis courts and a school of sailing.
There are a parking lot for motor vehicles, a beach and a school of surfing and kite flying. Near the centre is the industrial zone, home to several factories and the town's landfill.

Frazioni 
The main frazioni are Colico Piano, Villatico, Curcio (and Palerma locality), Laghetto (composed of Borgonuovo, Corte, La Cà, Fumiarga, Piona localities), Posallo, Fontanedo, San Rocco.
They rise around the parochial churches, whose origins go back to various periods. The most ancient is the parish of Nicola of Bari (celebrated on 6 December) in Olgiasca; traces of its building go back to 1252. A document dated 7 November 1593 speaks of the ""Parish priory, or Piona Abbey"", in charge of Cistercian monks.

Economy 
The economy is mainly based on tourism, but industry holds a strong second place, as the expanding industrial zone shows, and there is also a large presence of banks. The tourism is mainly focused on the many campsites. The industry boasts leading brands of construction trucks (Iveco) and yachts (Cranchi).

Transportation 

Colico is served by a railway station on the Tirano–Lecco railway, which was once electrified with three phase - 3000 V  by the Hungarian firm Ganz in 1901. Between 1885 and 1886 Colico was connected with Sondrio and Chiavenna, although a link with Lecco was active only from 1894. The line was then operated by the Adriatic Network, one of three major companies that remained in effect until 1905, year of birth of the Ferrovie dello Stato.

Piona has also a railway station.

115,"Santeramo in Colle (Santermano: ) is a town in the Metropolitan City of Bari and region of Apulia, southern Italy.

Its current name comes from St Erasmus, martyr of the Diocletian era and patron saint of the city who, according to legend, is responsible for its founding.

Physical geography 
By altitude, Santeramo in Colle is the highest municipality in the metropolitan city of Bari.

The countryside has the typical geomorphological features of the karst territory: a limestone substrate, with rocky out croups and the presence of lamas (Lamalunga, Lamadavruscio, Lamadispina, Lamasinara, Lamadilupo), jazzi (Iazzitello, Iazzo vecchio, Iazzo Sava, Iazzo De Laurentiis, Iazzo De Luca), Sinkhole e Ponor, courts (Corte Finocchio, Curtocarosino, Curtolevacche, Curtopasso, Curtolafica), parks (Parco Giovanni, Parco Lanzano, Parconuovo, Parco del Trullo, Parco Sava, Parco Caldara), lakes (Lago Travato, Lagolupino, Lagolaguardia, Lagopalumbo, Lacometana), mountains (Montefungale, Montefreddo), wells (Pozzo Leone, Pozzopoveriello), fountains (Fontana di tavola, Fontanarosa).

Morphology 
Morphological and vegetative articulation allows to identify three distinct areas: the woods, the Murge, the matine.

Woods 
The wooded area of the territory is the located area in the direction of Bari, so called because in ancient times it saw the presence of vast extensions of oak forest extensions, today almost completely extinct, which have given way to cultivated land and heavily man-made areas. Also on via Alessandriello there is the Denora wood, while on the way to Matera there is the Parata wood.

The Murge 
The Murge are the element that most characterizes the territory of Santeramo and are mainly made up of limestone rocks, which cross from South to North from Serrone to Murgia Sgolgore. Particular are the Quite, on via Alessandriello, characterized by an orderly mesh of dry stone walls (i parate), trulletti (i casédde) and specchie.

The matine 
The Matine, in the direction of Matera, are represented by a vast plain, once marshy, which constitutes the fertile area of the santermano territory and is characterized by extensive cereal cops and the presence of numerous rural settlements.

The caves 
The territory is characterized by numerous karst cavities that create a dense network of underground tunnels.

Climate 
The climate of Santeramo is a temperate continental climate, due to the  altitude and the distance from the sea.

The temperature in winter is around +4°C, while in summer it fluctuates around +21°C with a high percentage of humidity. 

Annual rainfall is around 600 mm. In winter, snow frequently falls, especially in the presence of cold air of Balkan origin, with sometimes considerable accumulations.

In the winter months, fog is frequent, especially in anticyclonic conditions or with southern humid currents, coming from the lonian Sea.   

Santeramo appears to be the coldest place among those falling in the metropolitan city of Bari.

The Italian climatic class is D, the degrees day are 1884.

Origins of the name 
The toponym Santeramo has medieval origins.

Several hypotheses have been advanced on the city name, among which there is one that claims it may refer to a place of worship: Santo Luogo dell'Eremo, with the presence of an adjoining monastery, built after the XI secolo, to which it was probably introduced the adjective of ""Santo"". The first document, confirming this hypothesis, which refers to the toponym ""Ad Sanctum Eramum"" (Santo Eramo / Eramo Santo) appears for the first time in a document ""Privilege of Costance"", preserved, in original, in the Tabulario di Santa Maria la Nova, and is dated Palermo 1996 December, XVI Ind. Ad Sanctum Eramum probably referred to the role played by the Machaelic cult in the territory. The hermitage of Sant'Angelo.

Another, however, supports the reference to the Martyr Erasmian, a hypothesis also supported by many local scholars. There are paper references from the XII secolo (there is a charta dated to 1180). The cult of S.Erasm must have been widespread since before the XI century.

History

The Antica Lupatia

The history of pre-Roman Santeramo - the ancient city of Peuceta 
The modern town of Santeramo, made up of curved walls, is set on an area of very ancient frequentation. The foundations of the ancient town are formed by three side by side alignments of shapeless limestone blocks, with a foundation thickness of 30-40 cm. Floor beaten in concotto and tuff.

During the excavations that look place in May 1980 in Santeramo, the Superintendency revealed the remains of two settlements attributable to the IX-VIIIand V-IV centuries. a.C. A loom weight was also found with the representation of a sphinx on both sides (the only example in Italy), certainly the symbolism of the sphinx and who and why used it must be investigated. The context is key to understanding its meaning. Furthermore, a stove was found consisting of thin superimposed layers of crushed stone, clay and coal, resting on a plane of small limestone slabs, overlooking a large patch of ash and coal (in the report of the excavation of the Archaeological Superintendece of Taranto).

The Peucetians settlement of Santeramo belongs to the typology of centers located inland (inland) and developed on the promontory that dominated the whole surrounding area, a geographical position of control, exploiting the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of the land, corresponding to the fertile territories, torrential furrows of rainwater collection basins, the blades and, in the presence of ancient karst (caves). The presence of the ancient karst lake is confirmed.

The Roman phase 
The Borgo Antico can be divided into the original Peucetian area and the area of subsequent Roman expansion, probably to be ascribed to the period from the presumed reconstruction in the 1st century a.C. and up to the early centuries EV. The previous Borgo Antico then expanded into the early medieval town surrounded by wallls.

An exemplary finding concerns an epighaph found in a garden belonging to Antonio di Santo, which bears the name of the deceased -ELASIV- (subsequently classified (v)/(c)-ELASIV-(s)), and placed by Theodor Mommsen between the Santeramo and gioiese area.

The origin of the toponym Lupatia 
Making a summary of the studies relating to the etymology of the toponym, we find:

Lupatia (lib/lub)         Λιβαδιον   valley)                                        G. Colella

(lub-)                    Root extrude lup-  (which is about death)             G. Alessio, S. Bekakos

(lib-)                    Stagnant water G. Alessio (most recent)

Aliba (lib-)              Place of worship of water and the e S. Bekakos

The foundation of Ancient Lupatia 
About the date of foundation of Lupatia, or rather of the birth of the poleonym, it is hypothesized at the turn of the IX and the end of the VII century a.C. Considering the numerous other toponyms around Canosa and their supposed closed-Perugian origin, a high dating would seem more probable. But this obviously requires further confirmation. In these areas of Peucezia, in fact, most of the settlements have been frequented at least since the Apennine culture. By foundation we therefore intend to hypothesize that period of time in which we began to speak of the ancient settlement through the Etruscan root. Therefore, more than a foundation, we should speak of poleonímica connotation.

The Territory of Santeramo

The Neolithic 
The assiduous human presence in the Santeramo area has been witnessed since the Neolithic, given the discovery of many elements belonging to this historical phase, specifically in the area known as  Le Matine, located southof the current city center and characterized by flat soil, first marshy at the end of the seconda fase sub-boreale and then wooded in the Neolithic, due to probable reclamation in the epoca romana.

The entrenched Neolithic village of Masseria Fontana di Tavola of Talve 
The site of Masseria Fontana di Tavola is located along the Via Appia Antica (also called 'Via Tarantina'), which delineates the border between Santeramo in Colle and Matera. It is located in the locality of Valzerosso, near a small valley crossed by a branch of the Silica, on a flat area which, proceeding eastwards, ends with a slight difference in height. Currently the area is privately owned and a cereal farm has been set up there.

Etymologically, the place name would mean 'Source of the River Talvo'. In fact
this area must have been the source of this watercourse which flanked the city of Castellaneta and of which various sources speak from 
the Roman period up to more recent times. To cite a few: «CASTELLANETTA: west of Metula, on the Talvo river. It has a Suffragan Bishopric
of the Archbishop of Taranto». 

The quantity of ceramic fragments found can be ascribed to the chronological horizon between the Neolithic, the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age, collected on the site of Masseria Fontana di Tavola.
The study of the ceramic finds has led to believe that the area was frequented and occupied more assiduously during the 
Ancient Neolithic, given the preponderance of archaic impressed ceramics (especially in the area between Altamura and Santeramo in Colle). In this regard, Damiana Santoro argued that ""the findings denote a more widespread population during the
Early Neolithic phase; in the Middle-Recent Neolithic there seems to be a tendency towards a thinning out, or rather a concentration of the inhabited areas, probably as a result of changing needs to be reconnected to different environmental climatic conditions"". The analysis of the findings of Masseria Fontana di Tavola allows us to verify that the side had a period of re-occupation during the Neolithic-Final, considering the large number of Diana-style fragments, in the inhabited areas and a resettlement found also in other areas of southern Italy, only to be re-dimensioned again during the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age.

The entrenched Neolithic village of Masseria Grottillo 
Within the landscape of the Upper Murgia of Santeramo in Colle, the remains of the entrenched Neolithic village of Masseria Grottillo are identified, which are of considerable interest from an archaeological point of view.
The entrenched Neolithic village was identified by Materano scholar Gianfranco Leonetti, in the field of topographic research and subject only to the constraint of the Archaeological Superintendency of Taranto - Dr. Donata Venturo on 26 May 1997 and has been studied since then. The village is currently in a state of neglect.

The large Peuceta settlement of Masseria Di Santo and Bonifacio 
On the basis of some studies, it emerged that
the archaeological site in question is located in the area of the Di Santo and Bonifacio farms S-SE of the town of Santeramo in Colle, height of 360 m.
The site dominates the valley below and is crossed by ancient paths, N-NS and E-ES, not easily definable in time, which reached the Viglione farm, which coincides with Sublupatia, a station of the Via Appia.
The Biancofiore, had been, as today, a sorting center of different roads.
Like Sublupatia, which was not only a station of the Via Appia, but also the node from where the connection to the Minucia, briefly testified by the Tabula Peutingeriana which also in the area no longer shows the Via Appia, but with greater precision by the Cosmographia Anonimo Ravennatis and by the Guidonis Geographia.

The Peuceti settlements were often located in the vicinity if the villages occupied in prehistoric times. The site in question, in fact, is about 500 meters away from the well-known Neolithic village of Masseria Grottillo about 3 km from the Ancient Appian Way.
The site had been reported to the Archaeological Superintendency of Taranto starting from 1980 by the Honorary Inspector Gianni De Santis.
Mangiatordi tells us nothing new, writes only that on the site: ceramic fragments ascribable to the late Republican age and the early age were collectd imperiale.
To confirm the importance of the site is C. S. Fioriello, of the University of Bari, in 2017 after a detailed inspection.

In the area many fragments of indigenous and linear geometric pottery, black painted pottery, African sealed earth are scattered over the entire surface. Late Roman painted and kitchen pottery, various tiles, fragments of sarcophagi and hundreds of loom weights and a bronze loom weight (in peasant possession) 10 cm high.

In the area between Masseria Bonifacio and Masseria Di Santo, in the absence of scientific excavation, despite the quantity of findings that would allow us to formulate certain hypotheses on the characteristics of the settlement, it is possible to hypothesize the presence of a residential nucleus of significant socio-economy entity, given the proximity, even of two probable villas of the imperial age recognized in the nearby Masseria Bonifacio.

In the area of Masseria Bonifacio, there is an olive grove at the entrance of which there is a hypogeum, the epicenter of the entire area of the Di Santo Bonifacio farms.

The hypogeum is an underground system, 10 meters long, which has a relevant geological, geomorphological, archaeological and historical interest. From the main access, you can reach a succession of huge saloons. The cave has a karst and hypogea nature and there are fossilized remains on the wall. It's an inlet, which was artificially closed with carry-over material and boulder, that block the access to others rooms. Inside it, have been found the silvers of pottery and bones, which date from Neolothic to others age. Among them are reported: a Greek Obol from the IV century, 3 fragments, that are part of a tray, so described by dr. Philip Kenrick: Rectengular tray made with African sealed ceramic (7th figure). Two fragments made with fine red clay and a barely shiny red flap belong to a rectengular rely, which is decorated with embossed mould. These trays were built at the central Tunisian production site in Sidi Marzouk Tounis and they have beendated approximately (from silver prototypes) to the second half of the 4th Century A.D. The fragments from Masseria Bonifacio's cave come from the edge of a unique tray depicting scenes from Achille's life. There is a complete example in Monaco's Archäologische Staatssammlung (ex Prähistorische Staatssammlung) (Garbsch 1980, 1982, 100 n.36). The two fragments of Masseria Bonifacio show: a hare supported by its hind legs by a centaur (towards the left end of the bottom edge); a sitting woman spinning, who is portrayed as Deidameia, one of Achille's admirers when it hidden about the king Lycomede at the court in Skyros (towards the lower end of the right side). The theme of this Tray, has also been discussed in detail by Mackensen (2004). The shape of the ship is Hayes (1972), mentioned as such in Anselmino. The African lamp's shape is Hayes (1972) Typer II, (fine-grained fabric, neat and sharp decoration) from central Tunisia. The pattern of the disc is a chi-rho symbol, with the rho inverted: for similar examples, watch Bailey 1988, n. Q1755-7. Dated around 400-500 d.C. 

The hypogeum was fixed in the past for the burials and later, in the 4th or 5th Century d.C., was used as a refuge (to confirm this dating, it's the construction techniques of the inner walls).

Hellenism 
The Greek phase of Santeramo, characterized by the presence of Japygian ceramics and the persistence of forms in polished dough of the proto-Villanovan tradition, finds numerous elements of comparison in the phase of Gravina I, dated from 825 to 725a.C. And, in particular, significant are the numerous and punctual comparisons with the decorative motifs found in the geometric ceramic of Gravina, recently inserted by Yntema in the most ancient phase of the iapigia production, dated in a chronological period ranging from the IX to the beginning of the VIII century a.C. The analogies with Gravina I are obviously not accidental, if we consider the position of the two located, such as the nearby centres of Altamura and Monte Sannace, in the hinterland of Peucezia, on the edge of the Murgic plateau, etc. etc."" The ""Borgo Antico"" can be divided into the original Peucetian area and the area of subsequent ""Roman"" expansion, probably due to the period from the presumed reconstruction in the 1st century a.C. and up to the first centuries EV.

Middle Ages 
The Norman period is characterized by the study of the Catalogus Baronum, just as the study of the Statutum de reparatione castrorum is fundamental for the Swabian age. This last study deals with an investigation that Federico II started on the basis of the Norman models, on the localities required to repair the royal fortresses.

The domus were particularly numerous in Apulia: out of eighty-two building structures listed in the Statutum de reparatione, thirty-five were such, most of which located in the Capitanata area. In this territory favored by Frederick II their number (twenty-eight) exceeded that of the castra (twenty-three), while in the Land of Bari we find only three compared to thirteen castras and, similarly, in the Terra d'Otranto only two compared to thirteen castras. The domus of the Capitanata were located in Apricena, S. Eleuterio, Rignano Garganico, Sala, S. Chirico, Lama, Fiorentino, Guardiola, Visciglieto, Lucera (masseria), Castiglione, Foggia, Pantano-S, Lorenzo, S. Spirito di Gulfiniano, Incoronata, Salpi, S. Maria ""de Mari"", S. Maria ""de Salina"", Trinitapoli, Ponte Albanito, Orta, Ordona, Stornara, Cerignola, Celano, Salsiburgo, S. Maria ""in Bircis"", Girofalco. In the rest  Puglia, they were located in Garagnone, Gravina, Santeramo, Castellaneta, Girofalco e Montalbano; in the area of Basilicata they were located in Gaudiano, S. Nicola d'Ofanto, Cisterna, Lavello, Boreano, Lagopesole, Montemarcone, Monteserico e Agromonte.

Modern era 
The phenomenon of post-unit brigandage also developed in Santeramo in Colle, bands of town brigands and also bands of other brigands such as Carmine Crocco operated.

Cinema 
In the countryside of Santeramo between 1930 and 1931 some scenes of the silent film  Idillio Infranto, directed by  Nello Mauri with Ida Mantovani and other amateur actors were shot.

In 1994 the town was chosen as the setting for  Da do da (in dialetto barese: ""Da qui a là""), directed by Nico Cirasola, a fantastic narration of the descent of the Olimpo in a town in southern Italy.

Kitchen 
The typical Santermana cuisine is essentially based on local products: wheat, oil, wine, meats, cheeses, vegetables and fruit.

The production of significant quantities of cereals in the flat area of the Matine allows the production of products such as bread baked ina wood oven, biscuits, taralli, focaccia, friselle. The typical pasta is handmade with durum wheat semolina and takes the form of cavatelli, orecchiette, fricelli.

Typical dishes are orecchiette with fricelli, orecchiette with turnip tops, cavatelli with chops sauce, long cavatelli with cauliflower and fried breadcrumbs, cavatelli with cardoncelli mushrooms, white beans with chicory campestri, lamb on the spit with potatoes and onions, ""gnumiredde"" (rolls of lamb wrapped in the guts of the same animal),  lampascioni boiled with oil and pepper. The consumption of horse meat (horse and donkey) is also widespread.

Among the typical sweets there are the marzipan castagnelle, the carteddate and the purciddi with the vincotto obtained from cooking figs, the Easter scarcedde with boiled eggs in the shape of doves, horses and handbags.

Of note is the production of wines, including Primitivo and Novello.

Events 

 Patronal Festival of Sant'Erasmo is held in early June, with the solemn mass dedicated to the Patron, followed by the procession and the launch of balloons.The ride in typical ancient costumes takes place with ladies and knights followed by the triumphal chariot on which the holy image of the saint is placed. At the end of the evening a choreographic fireworks display closes the party.

 Ripa Prize for philanthropic activities was established by Decree by the President of the Republic over half a century ago. It awards scholarships given by the ancient Ripa family and is held annually in conjunction with the religious celebrations of the patron saint in early June.

Economy 
The surrounding area is characterized by the presence of numerous agro-zootechnical companies. The main agricultural activities concern the cultivation of wine grapes and olive trees. Santeramo is famous for sheep and cattle but above all horses, and is known throughout the area as the ""City of horse meat"".

Defined the ""Switzerland of Italy"" until a few years ago, due to the very low unemployment rate without source, Santeramo also boasts primacy of ""World City of the Living Room"", as the headquarters of Industry Natuzzi leader of upholstered furniture listed on the  Wall Street stock exchange.

116,"Brownie is the nickname for a Fender Stratocaster that was used extensively by Eric Clapton during the early 1970s, most notably with Derek and the Dominos on their 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.

Overview
The guitar has an alder body, two-tone sunburst finish, a maple neck, skunk-stripe on the back of the neck, routing and black dot inlays. It was manufactured in 1956 and the serial number is 12073. Clapton purchased the guitar at London's Sound City while touring with Cream on 7 May 1967 for US$400 and used it for both concert and studio. The guitar appeared on his debut album Eric Clapton where it can be seen on the cover. Its most noteworthy usage can be heard on the Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs album also recorded in 1970. But after 1971, Brownie served as back-up for Clapton's main Fender Stratocaster, Blackie. At the 1969 Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park, London, Clapton played a Fender Custom Telecaster, which was fitted with Brownie's neck. Clapton preferred to buy a neck with a worn fretboard rather than a new one as he felt that a neck worn from playing had obviously been favoured by players, and was likely to play very well.

Brownie for auction
On 24 June 1999 Clapton sold the guitar through Christie's Auction House in New York City to help raise funds for his alcohol and drug treatment center, Crossroads Centre. Brownie sold for US$497,500 becoming the most expensive guitar ever sold at the time only to be eclipsed by Clapton's other favourite guitar Blackie on 24 June 2004. Brownie can now be seen by the public at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington under the ownership of Paul Allen. In 2006, another Stratocaster, signed by a large group of celebrities, including Clapton, was auctioned to benefit the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, selling for US$2.6 million, shattering Brownie's record.

Custom Shop reproduction
In February 2013, Fender announced a Custom Shop reproduction of Brownie available exclusively through Guitar Center on 21 March 2013. The manufacturer's suggested retail price (USD) of the tribute guitar is valued at US$14,999.00.

122,"Abraham Darby (synonyms AUScot, Candy Rain, Country Darby tree) is a popular apricot Shrub rose cultivar which was introduced by David Austin in England in 1985. The English rose was bred by crossing the climber 'Aloha' with the floribunda 'Yellow Cushion' and is named after the industrialist Abraham Darby, the constructor of the first iron bridge, which is situated less than 15 km from David Austin's nurseries. The naming happened in collaboration with the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust.

'Abraham Darby' is an old-fashioned looking rose with many large, showy flowers with a classic quartered shape in an apricot-pink colour which varies with climate and age. It ranges from soft apricot pink on the inside, pale yellow on the outside in warmer areas to a rich peachy pink with lighter edges in cooler climates. Additionally the colour pales as the flower matures.
The cupped flowers have an average diameter of  and up to 70 petals. They usually have strong, fruity fragrance, grow in small clusters and appear abundantly throughout the season. As the rather heavy flowers tend to bow their heads, Abraham Darby is suited to be trained as a climber.

The cultivar is winter hardy down to −20 °C (USDA zone 6 – 10b) and generally disease resistant, but can be susceptible to rust. The vigorous plant grows very bushy growing approximately  high and  wide. It is almost thornless and has glossy, leathery foliage of a medium to dark green colour. Due to its long arching shoots, it can be grown as a freestanding shrub or trained as a climber, if given some support. The cultivar can be used in flower beds, rose borders, landscaping or as container rose in sunny or partially shaded locations, and is well suited as cut flower.

'Abraham Darby' is used as a parent rose and was used to hybridise the cultivars 'Crown Princess Margareta' (1991), 'Golden Celebration' (1992), 'Pat Austin' (1995) and 'Marianne' (2001).

123,"Rājputhana, meaning ""Land of the Rajputs"", was a region in South Asia that included mainly the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan, as well as parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, and some adjoining areas of Sindh in modern-day southern Pakistan.

The main settlements to the west of the Aravalli Hills came to be known as Rajputana, early in the Medieval Period. The name was later adopted by British government as the Rajputana Agency for its dependencies in the region of the present-day Indian state of Rājasthān. The Rajputana Agency included 18 princely states, two chiefships and the British district of Ajmer-Merwara. This British official term remained until its replacement by ""Rajasthan"" in the constitution of 1949.

Name
George Thomas (Military Memories) was the first in 1800, to term this region the Rajputana Agency. The historian John Keay in his book, India: A History, stated that the Rajputana name was coined by the British, but that the word achieved a retrospective authenticity: in an 1829 translation of Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, John Briggs discarded the phrase ""Indian princes"", as rendered in Dow's earlier version, and substituted ""Rajpoot princes"".

The region was previously long known as Gujratra (an early form of ""Gujarat""), before it came to be called Rajputana during the medieval period.

Geography 
The area of Rajputana is estimated to be 343,328 square km (132,559 square miles) and breaks down into two geographic divisions:

 An area northwest of the Arāvalli Range including part of the Great Indian (Thar) Desert, with characteristics of being sandy and unproductive.
 A higher area southeast of the range, which is fertile by comparison.

The whole area forms the hill and plateau country between the north Indian plains and the main plateau of peninsular India.

124,"State Highway 34 (abbreviated SH-34) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It runs for  south-to-north in the western part of the state. The highway begins northeast of Eldorado, in the southwest corner of the state, and extends north to the Kansas state line between Woodward and Coldwater, Kansas.

SH-34 has always been a lengthy highway, starting with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed the same basic corridor since its inception, with the exception of the portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.

There are three letter-suffixed spur highways branching from SH-34. SH-34A and SH-34B serve small towns in Greer County off the mainline of SH-34, while SH-34C serves Boiling Springs State Park.

For much of its extent, State Highway 34 passes through rural areas, running through the plains of western Oklahoma. The highway begins at SH-6 six miles (10 km) northeast of Eldorado. Heading north from there, it intersects U.S. Route 62 (US-62) just east of Duke. The highway continues north into Greer County to its county seat of Mangum, where SH-34 joins US-283. Two miles (3 km) north of Mangum, SH-9 joins for a four-mile (6 km) concurrency with SH-34 and US-283. Thereafter, SH-9 splits off to the east.

Nine miles (14 km) north of Mangum, SH-34B branches off to the west, connecting to the town of Brinkman, and four miles (6 km) later, SH-34A branches off to the west to the town of Willow. US-283 splits off to the northwest two miles (3 km) after that, and SH-34 continues north, crossing into Beckham County. SH-34 then bridges over the North Fork of the Red River. In Carter, the highway serves as the western terminus of SH-55. Five miles (8 km) north of Carter, SH-34 crosses SH-152.

SH-34 continues on to an interchange with Interstate 40 (I-40) west of Elk City. Here, the highway begins a concurrency with eastbound I-40. SH-34 accesses I-40 from exit 32, a partial diamond interchange, with no access to or from I-40 eastbound; the missing movements must be completed via another partial interchange further to the east, also numbered as exit 32, which serves Business I-40 (I-40 BUS). SH-34 follows I-40 to the east for . While concurrent with I-40, SH-34 has an interchange with SH-6, its northernmost junction with the latter highway. SH-34 exits the interstate from the left at exit 41 on the east side of Elk City, turning back to the north and intersecting I-40 BUS. The highway continues north out of Elk City, exiting Beckham County.

After leaving Beckham County, SH-34 enters Roger Mills County. SH-73's western terminus is at SH-34 at nine miles (14 km) north of Elk City. North of this junction, SH-34 lies along the Roger Mills–Custer county line, which it continues to follow as it passes through the east side of Hammon, where it meets State Highway 33. North of town, the route crosses over the Washita River, and shortly thereafter turns northeast to fully enter Custer County. Northwest of Moorewood, the highway crosses into Dewey County.

In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses SH-47, two miles (3 km) south of Leedey, and crosses the Canadian River near the unincorporated settlement of Trail. The highway then passes through Camargo. Just east of Vici, SH-34 joins US-60 and SH-51 for a one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici. The highway passes through Sharon north of Vici, then joins US-183/US-270/SH-3 four miles (6 km) southeast of Woodward. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets off to the north alone, and right after crossing the North Canadian River, SH-34C branches to the east about two miles (3 km) north of Woodward, connecting to Boiling Springs State Park.

SH-34 joins US-64 in far eastern Harper County for a four-mile (6 km) concurrency to the east, crossing the Cimarron River  east of Buffalo. The highway then turns back to the north, where it is  to its terminus at the Kansas state line.

History
State Highway 34 was first designated on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway began at the free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 to the point that is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.

SH-34 was rerouted north of Buffalo on January 30, 1934. The new alignment continued due north out of Buffalo to the Kansas state line along a new road. The old portion of SH-34 between US-64 and the Kansas state line became part of SH-50.

The next major change to SH-34 occurred in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned to follow a new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.

The next major change to SH-34 would be brought about by the establishment of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975. SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.

The final modification to SH-34 occurred just under a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 instead of the old alignment of the now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40. No further changes have taken place since then.

Junction list

Spurs

SH-34A

SH-34A is a  spur connecting SH-34 with Willow, north of Mangum. The highway begins at the west edge of Willow and follows Main Street east as it bisects the town. East of the town limits, the highway intersects US-283/SH-34 and ends.

SH-34A first appeared on the 1944 state highway map.

SH-34B

SH-34B is a  spur connecting SH-34 with Brinkman, north of Mangum. The highway follows Main Street from unincorporated Brinkman to US-283/SH-34.

SH-34B first appeared on the 1944 state highway map.

SH-34C

SH-34C is a  spur connecting SH-34 with Boiling Springs State Park north of Woodward. The highway heads east from SH-34, curving northeast near the park's golf course, before making a sharp turn toward the northeast. The highway ends on the west side of the park, with an access road continuing through it; on the east side of the park, the access road intersects SH-50B at its western terminus.

The road that is currently SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in Woodward and headed north, then turned east north of the city and headed to Boiling Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing through the park and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road through the park had been removed from the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.

131,"""Love Me for a Reason"" is a song by Johnny Bristol covered by The Osmonds, and released in 1974. Twenty years later, Boyzone covered the song. Both versions were successful, reaching the top ten of the charts in many countries.

Original song and covers 
The original version by Johnny Bristol, from his 1974 album Hang On In There Baby, was released as a single on MGM in 1974, but ""Love Me for a Reason"" quickly became associated with another MGM act, The Osmonds. It was their last top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, reaching #10; it peaked at #2 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In the UK Singles Chart it fared even better, spending three weeks at the top in August 1974. There was a lovers rock version of the song issued on Trojan records in 1976, credited to the Fabulous Five Inc (aka Fab Five Inc), that scored well in Jamaica and in the United Kingdom.

Boyzone version 

The song was revived by Irish boy band Boyzone in 1994, becoming their breakthrough single, reaching number one on the Irish Singles Chart and number two on the UK Singles Chart. It was the 19th-best-selling single of 1994 in the UK and received a gold sales status certification for shipping over 400,000 copies in the UK.

Critical reception 
Peter Fawthrop from AllMusic viewed the song as a ""peppy tribute"" to the Osmonds. Music writer James Masterton wrote in his weekly UK chart commentary, ""Be warned. This is just the first instalment of a cover battle over this song and could well be the start of a mini-Osmonds revival in the new year. For now, this cover of the Osmonds classic 1974 No.1 becomes the debut hit for the latest crop of lads to make a bid for teen stardom. The timing of the release is impeccable. I'm a sucker for a good pop record, well made and this ranks with the best of all of them, the harmonies are impeccable and the song has a proven track record. Now strongly in the running for the coveted seasonal No.1 slot, Boyzone are off and running."" Alan Jones from Music Week said that the band ""enter the overcrowded teen heart-throbs staker, with a competent if uninspired rendition of the old Osmonds' hit, which should win them plenty of children's TV slots, and a place in the bottom half of the Top 40.""

Music video 
A music video was made to promote ""Love Me for a Reason"". It features the band performing the song in a basement, wearing black and white costumes. They are surrounded by large candelabras, curtains and pub height tables covered with candles. In between, a girl dressed in white appears. The video was published on YouTube in October 2009. It has amassed more than 15 million views as of September 2021.

132,"Across Suez, subtitled ""The Battle of the Chinese Farm October 15, 1973"" is a board wargame published by Simulations Publications (SPI) in 1980 that simulates operational level ground combat between Egypt and Israel at the Battle of the Chinese Farm during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.

Description
During the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Israeli forces tried to open a bridgehead over the Suez Canal to exploit a perceived gap in the Egyptian line, and instead ran up against a strong force. The battle took place in the vicinity of an Egyptian research station that used Japanese equipment. Israeli observers mistook the Japanese Kanji characters on the  machinery for Chinese Hanzi, leading to the misnomer ""The Chinese Farm"". Across Suez is a introductory-level simulation of this battle.

Components
 11"" x 17"" paper hex grid map
 40 die-cut counters
 rules booklet
 various playing aids
 a six-sided die
 small 9"" x 12"" x 1"" game box

Gameplay
Each turn represent 8 hours of game time, and takes the following sequence:
Israeli movement
Israeli combat
Egyptian movement
Egyptian combat
The game lasts seven turns.

Victory conditions
Israeli victory: The Israeli player must 
 place a bridging unit on a specific hex on the Suez Canal
 move a minimum of six combat units across the Suez
 maintain an unblocked line of communications to the bridging unit at the end of the last turn
Egyptian victory: Prevent any of the Istraeli victory conditions.

Publication history
In 1980, SPI published four ""gateway"" games in small boxes with simplified rules, intended to introduce new players to the wargaming hobby: Leningrad; The Big Red One (originally titled Bulge); Austerlitz; and Across Suez, a game designed by  Jim Dunnigan and Mark Herman, with cartography and graphic design by Redmond A. Simonsen.

After SPI went out of business, Decision Games acquired the license for Across Suez and republished it in 1995. Decision added two variants (airborne landings and amphibious landings) and two new scenarios, which required 16 additional Arab and Israeli counters and 18 Soviet and American counters.

Hobby Japan published a Japanese version.

Reception
In Issue 5 of Casus Belli, Henri Gregoire thought that the rules ""reflect the surprise and shock of the first fight."" He agreed this was a good game for beginners, pointing out that with only seven turns, the game was quick, and could be completed in two hours.

133,"Lelwani or Leluwani was a Hittite goddess of the underworld, equated with the Hurrian Allani under her Akkadian name Allatum.  She lived in the Dark Earth (the Hurro-Hittite underworld).

Gender and syncretism 

Lelwani was originally a male Hattian chthonic deity incorporated into Hittite religion, referred to as ""lord"" and ""king"" (katte in Hattic), and later became a female deity of the underworld  due to syncretism with female deities during the period of growing Hurrian influence on Hittite state cult. 

Allani and Lelwani coexisted as separate deities in god lists and in rituals. Allani was equated with the Hittite and Luwian Sun Goddess of the Earth, but Allatum - the Akkadian form of her name - was assigned to Lelwani instead.

Cult 
Lelwani was worshiped during festivals associated with the so-called ḫešta-house, such as purulli, described in the Hittite text CTH 645. Much like Lelwani, purulli had Hattic origin. While it was meant to celebrate renewal of life in spring, the invoked deities were linked to the underworld and in addition to Lelwani included the Hittite Šiwat (or Izzištanu in Hattic; a deity representing ""Propitious Day"" - the day on which a person dies) Ištuštaya and Papaya, among others.

In purulli and a ritual connected to building a new palace Lelwani was invoked alongside Ḫašammili, a divine blacksmith.

Queen Puduḫepa prayed to Lelwani to secure long, healthy lives for her family (an example can be found in KUB 21.27(+) III 31-38).

134,"Charles Ritchie Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen, PC (12 January 1908 – 23 June 1986) was a British judge and law lord.

Biography 
Russell was born in London, the son of Frank Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen and the grandson of Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen, both Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. His maternal grandfather was the Scottish politician Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee. Following his father, he was educated at Beaumont College and Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a Third in Jurisprudence. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1931.

During the Second World War, Russell was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, and flew into France on D-Day by glider. Wounded in action, he was mentioned in dispatches and received the French Croix de Guerre. Returning to the bar after the war, he took silk in 1948 at the age of forty, like his father and grandfather. He was Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall from 1951 to 1960. A leading Chancery counsel, he was appointed to the Chancery Division of the High Court in 1960, receiving the customary knighthood. He was promoted Lord Justice of Appeal in 1962, and was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1960 he pleaded guilty to a charge of drunk driving, which was thought to have delayed his promotion. Nevertheless, on 30 September 1975, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was made a life peer with the title Baron Russell of Killowen, of Killowen in the County Down, the same title that his grandfather and father had held.

135,"The ovarian surface epithelium, also called the germinal epithelium of Waldeyer, or coelomic epithelium is a layer of simple squamous-to-cuboidal epithelial cells covering the ovary.

The term germinal epithelium is a misnomer as it does not give rise to primary follicles.

Composition
These cells are derived from the mesoderm during embryonic development and are closely related to the mesothelium of the peritoneum. The germinal epithelium gives the ovary a dull gray color as compared with the shining smoothness of the peritoneum; and the transition between the mesothelium of the peritoneum and the cuboidal cells which cover the ovary is usually marked by a line around the anterior border of the ovary.

Diseases
Ovarian surface epithelium can give rise to surface epithelial-stromal tumor.

The RSWA was founded in 1914. It publishes the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia, and has awarded the Medal of the Royal Society of Western Australia (also known incorrectly as the Kelvin Medal) on an occasional basis since 1924.

Journal
The Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering scientific research carried out in Western Australia, or on topics related to Western Australia. It is the official journal of Royal Society of Western Australia and traces its roots to the Journal and Proceedings of the Mueller Botanic Society of Western Australia published from 1899 to 1903. The Mueller Botanic Society became the West Australian Natural History Society in 1903, and from 1904 to 1909, the journal was published as Journal of the West Australian Natural History Society. In 1909 the society again changed its name, becoming the Natural History and Science Society of Western Australia, and its journal was subsequently published as Journal of the Natural History and Science Society of Western Australia until 1914. In that year, the Royal Society of Western Australia was established, and the journal obtained its present name.

140,"The Agawam River is a  stream in southeastern Massachusetts, USA, that is part of the Wareham River estuary watershed. The Agawam River is named in honor of the peaceful Native Americans that helped the Massachusetts Bay Colony establish its first Connecticut River Valley settlement at Springfield, Massachusetts in 1636, and helped it to flourish while many of the Connecticut Colony settlements south of Springfield were attacked or destroyed by more war-like Native American tribes.

The Agawam River originates at Halfway Pond, east of the Myles Standish State Forest in Plymouth, flows southwest through Glen Charlie Pond and East Wareham, and drains into the Wareham River near the center of Wareham. As the estuary's major contributor of nutrients and fresh water, the Agawam was one of the most important herring rivers in Massachusetts. Its herring runs have been operated by European settlers since 1632 and were officially established as a managed run in 1832.

Even today, it remains one of the few managed herring runs in Massachusetts, although few fish reach the river's spawning and nursery habitat. It includes  of water bodies that could serve as habitat to alewife, blueback herring, and American shad. Approximately 36% of this habitat is in Halfway Pond. Fishway retrofit projects aim to restore river herring population to historic levels, perhaps as many as 100,000+ fish annually.

The Agawam River receives discharges from the Wareham Sewage Treatment plant, which discharges  per day of nitrogen-rich sewage effluent.

141,"Romanée-Saint-Vivant is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. It is situated within the commune of Vosne-Romanée. La Romanée borders on La Grande Rue in the south, Romanée-Conti and Richebourg in the west, Vosne-Romanée Premier Cru vineyards in the north (Les Suchots) and in the east (La Croix-Rameau and Les Gaudichots) and also the village Vosne-Romanée itself in the east. The AOC was created in 1936. It takes its name from the Abbey of Saint Vivant, which in Medieval times owned several vineyards among the Vosne-Romanée Grands Crus.

History
There are several different vineyard owners in Romanée-Saint-Vivant today, although Domaine de la Romanée-Conti is the largest. The entire vineyard of Romanée Saint-Vivant was bought in 1791 by Nicolas-Joseph Marey, son-in-law of the geometer Gaspard Monge, when it was up for sale after the French Revolution after much land had been sequestered. After keeping it as a monopole for over 100 years, the Marey-Monge family sold off the southwestern part of the vineyard (lieu-dit Le Clos des Quatre Journeaux) to the Latour family in 1898, which in turn later resold around half of it. At a later stage, another portion in the northern part of the vineyard was sold to Charles Noellat. In 1966, the last member of the Marey-Monge family leased the remaining  to Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and also gave them an option to be first buyers if the vineyard would come up for sale. In 1988, the vineyard was bought from the Neyroud family, which had inherited it from Ms Marey-Monge. This last deal was financed by the sale and leaseback of the domaine's holdings in Échezeaux and parts of Grands Échezeaux, as well as the sale of some Premier Cru and village level vineyards in Vosne-Romanée. Wine from the time when Domaine de la Romanée-Conti leased it, rather than owned it, also has the name Marey-Monge on the label.

Production
In 2008,  of vineyard surface was in production within the AOC, and 237 hectoliter of wine was produced, corresponding to just under 32,000 bottles.

AOC regulations
The main grape variety for Romanée-Saint-Vivant is Pinot noir. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes, but this is practically never used for any Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare, a minimum planting density of 9,000 vines per hectare and a minimum grape maturity of 11.5 per cent potential alcohol is required.

142,"NMDA receptor antagonists are a class of drugs that work to antagonize, or inhibit the action of, the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). They are commonly used as anesthetics for animals and humans; the state of anesthesia they induce is referred to as dissociative anesthesia.

Several synthetic opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as pethidine, levorphanol, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, tramadol and ketobemidone.

Some NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, dextromethorphan (DXM), phencyclidine (PCP), methoxetamine (MXE), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are sometimes used as recreational drugs, for their dissociative, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant properties. When used recreationally, they are classified as dissociative drugs.

Uses and effects
NMDA receptor antagonists induce a state called dissociative anesthesia, marked by catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia. Ketamine is a favored anesthetic for emergency patients with unknown medical history and in the treatment of burn victims because it depresses breathing and circulation less than other anesthetics. Dextrorphan, a metabolite of dextromethorphan (one of the most commonly used cough suppressants in the world), is known to be an NMDA receptor antagonist.

Depressed NMDA receptor function is associated with an array of negative symptoms. For example, NMDA receptor hypofunction that occurs as the brain ages may be partially responsible for memory deficits associated with aging. Schizophrenia may also have to do with irregular NMDA receptor function (the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia). Increased levels of another NMDA antagonist, kynurenic acid, may aggravate the symptoms of schizophrenia, according to the ""kynurenic hypothesis"". NMDA receptor antagonists can mimic these problems; they sometimes induce ""psychotomimetic"" side effects, symptoms resembling psychosis. Such side effects caused by NMDA receptor inhibitors include hallucinations, paranoid delusions, confusion, difficulty concentrating, agitation, alterations in mood, nightmares, catatonia, ataxia, anesthesia, and learning and memory deficits.

Because of these psychotomimetic effects, NMDA receptor antagonists, especially phencyclidine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan, are used as recreational drugs. At subanesthetic doses, these drugs have mild stimulant effects and, at higher doses, begin inducing dissociation and hallucinations, though these effects and the strength thereof vary from drug to drug.

Most NMDA receptor antagonists are metabolized in the liver. Frequent administration of most NMDA receptor antagonists can lead to tolerance, whereby the liver will more quickly eliminate NMDA receptor antagonists from the bloodstream.

NMDA receptor antagonists are also under investigation as antidepressants. Ketamine, in particular, has been demonstrated to produce lasting antidepressant effects after administration in a clinical setting. In 2019 esketamine, an NMDA antagonist enantiomer of ketamine, was approved for use as an antidepressant in the United States.

Neurotoxicity

Although NMDA antagonists were once thought to reliably cause neurotoxicity in humans in the form of Olney's lesions, recent research suggests otherwise. Olney's lesions involve mass vacuolization of neurons observed in rodents. However, many suggest that this is not a valid model of human use, and studies conducted on primates have shown that use must be heavy and chronic to cause neurotoxicity. A 2009 review found no evidence of ketamine-induced neuron death in humans. However, temporary and permanent cognitive impairments have been shown to occur in long-term or heavy human users of the NMDA antagonists PCP and ketamine. A large-scale, longitudinal study found that current frequent ketamine users have modest cognitive deficits, while infrequent or former heavy users do not.
Many drugs have been found that lessen the risk of neurotoxicity from NMDA receptor antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are thought to most directly target the etiology of NMDA neurotoxicity. Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, anticonvulsants, and muscimol.

Potential for treatment of excess excitotoxicity
Since NMDA receptor overactivation is implicated in excitotoxicity, NMDA receptor antagonists have held much promise for the treatment of conditions that involve excitotoxicity, including benzodiazepine withdrawal, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. This is counterbalanced by the risk of developing Olney's lesions, which have only ever been observed in rodents, and studies have started to find agents that prevent this neurotoxicity. Most clinical trials involving NMDA receptor antagonists have failed due to unwanted side effects of the drugs; since the receptors also play an important role in normal glutamatergic neurotransmission, blocking them causes side-effects. These results have not yet been reproduced in humans, however. Mild NMDA receptor antagonists like amitriptyline have been found to be helpful in benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Mechanism of action

The NMDA receptor is an ionotropic receptor that allows for the transfer of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and in the spinal column. For electrical signals to pass, the NMDA receptor must be open. To remain open, glutamate and glycine must bind to the NMDA receptor. An NMDA receptor that has glycine and glutamate bound to it and has an open ion channel is called ""activated.""

Chemicals that deactivate the NMDA receptor are called antagonists. NMDAR antagonists fall into four categories: Competitive antagonists, which bind to and block the binding site of the neurotransmitter glutamate; glycine antagonists, which bind to and block the glycine site; noncompetitive antagonists, which inhibit NMDARs by binding to allosteric sites; and uncompetitive antagonists, which block the ion channel by binding to a site within it.

143,"Eddie Reynolds (c. 1935 – 1993) was a Northern Irish footballer.

Eddie Reynolds joined Wimbledon FC from Tooting & Mitcham United FC during the 1957/58 season, scored 17 goals in 20 appearances in his first season – and remained a prolific goalscorer for the next seven seasons. His career at Wimbledon saw the club win the Isthmian League title four times (including three years in succession: 61/2, 62/3, and 63/4) and the FA Amateur Cup in 62/3.  In his last full season for the Dons, 1964/65 (Wimbledon's first season in the Southern League), he scored 57 goals in just 49 appearances – plus another 10 goals for the reserves. He scored in his final game against Worcester City in January 1966, was then transferred to Ashford Town and finally moved to Northern Ireland where he played for Derry City FC.

His most memorable feat was when he headed all four of Wimbledon's goals in their 4-2 FA Amateur Cup win over Sutton United in May 1963. He remains the only player in history ever to have scored four goals all with his head in a Wembley cup final.

Wimbledon's former Plough Lane stadium, which closed in 1991, was redeveloped as a housing estate in 2008 and named Reynolds Gate in his honour. Reynolds died in 1993 after a short illness.

It is the 2-chloro analogue of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, and is the 2-chloro positional isomer of chlorphentermine. Clortermine produces very low rates of self-administration in animals similarly to chlorphentermine, and as a result it likely does not act on dopamine. Instead, it may act as a serotonin and/or norepinephrine releasing agent.

148,"Walk In Lay Down (commonly referred to as WILD) is a biannual concert event held in the Brookings Quadrangle at Washington University in St. Louis and has been a campus tradition since its inception in 1973. WILD, produced by the WUSTL Social Programming Board, is sponsored by the Washington University Student Union and is the largest student run event at the university. WILD is free to university undergraduate students and has rooted itself in the campus culture as an exciting time of the semester for students of the university to get together and celebrate free live music, food, and friends.

History
WILD was first held in 1973 and was originally presented as a movie screening event. Around the 1980s, the event then expanded to incorporate musical acts to accompany the movies. By the early 1990s, the movies were dropped altogether and WILD became the music festival that it is now.

The concert is named for an old tradition in which students would bring sofas into the quad and lie on them while watching the performances. Although this tradition is no longer allowed, in Fall 2007 the university permitted that inflatable couches be allowed in the quad during the concert in an attempt to revive the tradition.

In 2013, production of WILD was passed on from student group Team 31 Productions to the WUSTL Social Programming Board.

Due to the university hosting the second 2016 presidential candidate debate on October 9th, Fall WILD 2016 was cancelled.

T-Pain was meant to headline Spring WILD 2019 but pulled out last minute due to a mandatory vocal rest. Roy Woods was booked as last minute as an additional performer as Loud Luxury was bumped to headliner. Elley Duhé was also meant to perform, but had to cancel the day of.

Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020, the university suspended in-person classes, requiring students to remain home for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester, causing Spring WILD 2020 to be cancelled.

Past WILD performers
The following is a chronology of past WILD performers. Highlighted in green are the WILD performers for the current semester.

151,"A penny war is a fundraising competition where two or more groups collect coins and bills in an effort to score points based on the amount and denomination collected.

Each group has a bucket for collecting the money; typically groups collect coins, but dollar bills may also be accepted. The value of any pennies collected by a group count toward that group's point total, while the value of other coins or dollar bills are subtracted. Hence, in a competition between Group A and Group B, a contributor who wants Group A to win will place pennies into Group A's bucket and nickels, dimes, quarters, or dollar bills into Group B's bucket.

At the end, a winner among the groups is declared, sometimes earning a small prize. The proceeds are donated to a specified charity or cause.

Takaloo was born in 1975 in Tehran, Iran. His family later fled the country in the late 1970s after the overthrow of the Shah. His family arrived in the south of England and he is now based in Margate, Kent.

Career
Takaloo boxed from an early age and won a number of amateur titles. In 1997, he became a professional boxer, losing two of his first seven bouts.

At this time he changed trainers and joined Jimmy O'Donnell's gym in London.

Takaloo is a showboat who had good head and body movement, but usually ended up looking bruised, battered but unbowed. His gutsy style made him a popular fighter in England. A one time world title contender and later WBU welterweight champion, Takaloo had problems obtaining a passport to fight outside the UK, but became a British citizen. As an amateur, he fought 72 times, winning 60 bouts, before turning professional in 1997.

He won the fringe WBU light-middleweight world championship belt in 2001 by beating the then undefeated Anthony Farnell in Manchester.  Following that, Takaloo secured a shot with WBO champion Daniel Santos at Cardiff Castle, Cardiff when he fought for the WBO and WBU light middleweight title. Takaloo lost this fight on points over twelve rounds.

Takaloo then moved down to welterweight following defeats to Eugenio Monteiro and a chilling knockout loss to unpredictable puncher Wayne Alexander. This move seemed to have been a success as he won the vacant title against Turgay Uzun in February 2006 at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands, and subsequently retained the title against Irish fighter Eamonn Magee on a points verdict.

Takaloo lost the WBU welterweight championship to former British Champion Michael Jennings by a unanimous points decision on 7 April 2007 and a further TKO loss to Anthony Small on 12 January 2008.

Electoral system 
The elections were conducted under two electoral systems. Twenty-one members were elected in single-member constituencies via first-past-the-post voting, while the remainder were elected using D'Hondt method proportional representation: twelve members in two-member constituencies, eight members in Reykjavík, and eleven from a single national compensatory list. To earn national list seats, a party had to win at least one constituency seat. In constituencies electing two or more members, within the party list, voters had the option to re-rank the candidates and could also strike a candidate out. Allocation of seats to candidates was done using a system based on the Borda count.

157,"Walter Richard ""Rick"" West Jr. (born January 6, 1943) is the president and CEO of the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles. He was the founding director of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, retiring from the position in 2007. He is also a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma and a Peace Chief of the Southern Cheyenne. His professional life has been devoted to serving the American Indian community on cultural, artistic, educational, legal and governmental issues.

Background 
Born in San Bernardino, California, West grew up in  a log cabin in Muskogee, Oklahoma.  He is the son of Maribelle McCrea West, a Baptist minister's daughter of Scottish-American background and the late Walter Richard West Sr. (1912–1996). His father, ""Dick"" West, was a well-respected Cheyenne painter, who chaired the art department at Bacone College.

Richard West earned a bachelor of arts degree in American history, graduating magna cum laude in 1965 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Redlands in California. He also received a master's degree in American history from Harvard University in 1968. West graduated from Stanford Law School with a doctor of jurisprudence degree in 1971, where he also was the recipient of the Hilmer Oehlmann Jr. Prize for excellence in legal writing and served as an editor and note editor of the Stanford Law Review.

Professional career
West was a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, and, subsequently, in the Indian-owned Albuquerque law firm of Gover, Stetson, Williams & West, P.C. During his law career, West served as both a general counsel and special counsel to a wide range of tribes and non-tribal organizations, before tribal, state, and federal and tribal courts. He also represented clients before several executive departments of the U.S. Federal Government and the Congress.

During his tenure in the Smithsonia, the Washington Post exposed his lavish travel expenses and a gala farewell celebration. This is part of a general crackdown on Smithsonian expenses by the General Accounting Office. West has stated that the travel was for museum business and approved by supervisors.  After conducting an investigation at the request of the United States Congress, the Smithsonian Institution's inspector general found that West ""should have exercised better judgment."" West has agreed to reimburse the Smithsonian $9,700. The Smithsonian Office of the Inspector General, A. Sprightley Ryan, published a 42-page report on October 28, 2008 responding to media reports and congressional requests.

From 2007 to 2010, West served as the Vice President of the International Council of Museums. In 2011, he was appointed as the Interim Director for the Textile Museum in Washington D.C. Since 2011, he has served on the Board of Directors of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation. In 2012, the Association of Tribal Archives, Libraries, & Museums (ATALM) honored West with a Guardians of Culture and Lifeways International Award and the Autry Museum of the American West designated West as the new President and CEO.

Personal life
West married Mary Beth Braden, a fellow Stanford graduate. She is the professor of political science at the National Defense University, Industrial College of the Armed Forces. Together they have two adult children, Amy and Ben.

The All-Star Game celebrated both the opening of the league's second soccer-specific stadium that season, as well as the announcement of the league's expansion with an eleventh team purchased by the owners of Mexico's Club Deportivo Guadalajara.  Then-MetroStars head coach Bob Bradley was tapped to lead the MLS All-Stars against Guadalajara, commonly known as Chivas, and led by their head coach, Eduardo de la Torre.

A scoreless first half was marked by a defensive effort for the All-Stars.  The Los Angeles Galaxy's Kevin Hartman made several key saves, while a backline led by Carlos Bocanegra of the Chicago Fire weathered a persistent Chivas attack.  The Fire's Ante Razov scored the first goal in the second half thanks in part to a feed by the San Jose Earthquakes' Landon Donovan past a beaten Oswaldo Sánchez.  Jair Garcia broke away from the defense and beat Hartman to tie the game, but the All-Stars responded shortly thereafter with the eventual-game winner by the Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz.  The Fire's DaMarcus Beasley tipped in the All-Stars' third goal, which Chivas contested because of an assistant referee's offside call, which was waved off by Kevin Terry.  A sellout crowd at The Home Depot Center celebrated the win, as well as the awarding of MVP to local favorite Carlos Ruiz.

160,"Alberni Inlet (formerly known as Alberni Canal) is a long, narrow inlet in Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, that stretches from the Pacific Ocean at Barkley Sound about  inland terminating at Port Alberni. It was named by the Spanish explorer Francisco de Eliza after Pedro de Alberní y Teixidor, Captain of the Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia who was appointed in the Spanish fort in Nootka Sound from 1790 to 1792. The inlet includes traditional territories of the Ucluelet, Uchucklesaht, Huu-ay-aht, Hupacasath, and Tseshaht peoples, who are part of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council people.

History

Exposed to the open Pacific, Alberni Inlet has been subject to tsunamis. The largest in historic times was the result of the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska in 1964, and destroyed part of downtown Port Alberni.

The narrow inlet amplified the size and intensity of the wave, and when it struck the two towns it had a height of . One hour later, a second, larger wave of  hit. It was the second wave that caused most of the damage, lifting houses off their foundations and sweeping log booms onto the shore. The second wave was followed by four more waves ranging in height from  and occurring at roughly 90-minute intervals. In total, the tsunami washed away 55 homes and damaged 375 others.

Tsunamis repeatedly hit the First Nations village Huu-ay-aht of Sarita, which is situated on a low sand beach about halfway along the inlet's eastern shore.

Name change
In 1931 there was a recommendation that the name be changed from canal to inlet so that foreign shippers would not mistake it for a canal. As described by the BC Geographical Names Information System:

The name change was officially approved in 1945.

Other inlets on the Northwest Coast continue to use ""canal"" names - the most notable being Lynn Canal, Portland Canal and Hood Canal.

161,"Barbara () was a Palestinian Arab village in the Gaza Subdistrict located 17 km northeast of Gaza city, in the vicinity of modern Ashkelon. It had an entirely Arab population of 2,410 in 1945. The village consisted of nearly 14,000 dunums of which approximately 12,700 dunums was able to be cultivated. It was captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

History
Barbara received its modern name from the Romans. After the Roman rule the village was under the control of a number of empires and dynasties ranging from the Byzantines, various Islamic Arab dynasties, the Crusaders, the Turkish Mamluks and Ottomans and United Kingdom.

Archeological building and pottery remains from  the Late  Roman and the Byzantine periods have been excavated here. Coins minted under Nero,  Valentinian II,  Theodosius I, Justin I and Justinian I were also found. A winepress, dating from the Byzantine period has been found.

A coin, dating from the  Umayyad (697–750 CE) era has also been found here

According to the Arab geographer Mujir al-Din (1456–1522), the village was home to the Muslim scholar sheikh Yusuf al-Barbarawi, a local sage and a student of renowned scholar Ahmad ibn Dawud, who died in 1323.

Ottoman period
During the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Murad III (1574-1596), Barbara's only mosque was built. It contained the tomb of Yusuf al-Barbarawi. In the 1596  tax registers, Barbara was part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza under the liwa' (district) of Gaza. It had a population of 73 Muslim households, an estimated 402 persons. They paid a fixed sum of 17,000 akçe in tax, where all the revenue went to a Muslim charitable endowment.

The village appeared under the  name of Hababeh on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799.

In 1838, Edward Robinson noted Burbarah as a Muslim village, located  in the Gaza district.

In May 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village. He estimated it had 400 inhabitants. He further noted a  wali, dedicated to a Sheik Yusuf, with sections of ancient  white-grey marble columns. Further five -six sections of marble column were observed around the well. Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that  Barbara had a total of 113 houses and a population of 372, though the population count included men only.  Hartmann  found that Barbara  had 112  houses.

In 1883  the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Barbara as a village rectangular in shape and surrounded by gardens and two ponds. The sand encroaching from the coast was stopped by the cactus hedges of the gardens. To the east of the village there were olive groves.

A building, dating to the late Ottoman, or early  British Mandate era have been excavated.

British Mandate of Palestine
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Barbara had a population of 1,369 inhabitants, all Muslims, which had increased in  the 1931 census  to 1546, still all Muslim, in 318 houses.

In the 1945 statistics  the population of Barbara consisted of  2,410 Muslims and the  land area was 13,978  dunams, according to an official land and population survey.  Of this, 132 dunams were designated for  citrus and bananas, 
2,952 for plantations and irrigable land, 9,615 for cereals, while 70 dunams were built-up areas.

At the end of the Mandate Period, the above-mentioned mosque, built late 1500, was still standing, and in addition the village center contained a number of shops. An elementary school was founded in 1921, and by 1947 it had 252 students. Barbara was also known for its long rugs, al-mazawid, which were woven by the women of the village.

1948 War
Barbara was captured by a possible combination of the Negev, Giv'ati and Yiftach brigades on November 5, 1948, during Operation Yoav. At the end of November 1948, Coastal Plain District troops carried  out  sweeps of the villages around and to the south of Majdal. Barbara was one of the villages named in the orders to the IDF battalions and engineers platoon, that the villagers were to be  expelled to Gaza, and the IDF troops were ""to prevent their return by destroying their villages."" The path leading to the village was to be mined. The IDF troops were ordered to carry out the operation ""with determination, accuracy and energy"". The operation took place on 30 November. The troops found ""about 40"" villagers in Barbara and al-Jiyya, ""composed of women, old men and children"", who offered no resistance.  They were expelled to Beit Hanun, in the northern Gaza strip. Eight young men who were found were sent to a POW camp.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and the moshavim of Mavki'im and Talmei Yafeh were established on the former village's land. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi (1992), the village remaining structures on the village land are: 
""The crumbled walls and debris of houses are all that remains of the village buildings. The debris is overgrown with thorns and brush. Old eucalyptus and sycamore trees and cactuses also grow on the site. Some of the old streets are clearly identifiable. One area of the site serves as a garbage dump and a junkyard for old cars. The surrounding lands are planted by Israeli farmers in corn.""

162,"The Fourche Creek watershed is arguably the most important urban watershed in the state of Arkansas in the United States for ecological, economic, and social reasons.

Tributaries to Fourche Creek include Fourche Bayou, Rock Creek, Otter Creek, Brodie Creek, Crooked Creek, and Panther Creek, as well as several smaller streams.

The watershed drains and filters runoff from 73% of Little Rock, Arkansas’s capital city, and drains into Fourche Creek. The city's wastewater treatment plant is located immediately above the Fourche/Arkansas River confluence, and the city of Little Rock cites the economic value and savings from natural purification in the Fourche Bottomlands to be in the millions of dollars.

Despite suffering decades of neglect and abuse, Fourche Creek supports a highly diverse population of flora and fauna and a core bottomland region that still maintains its wetland functions.  The watershed also acts as an urban restoration area for education and demonstration.  A revitalized watershed is of tremendous economic and social importance to Central Arkansas.

The Arkansas branch of the National Audubon Society is currently conducting numerous outreach, education, water quality improvement, and habitat improvement projects in the Fourche Creek watershed.

Fourche Creek is often confused with the Fourche La Fave River near Bigelow, Arkansas and with the Fourche River near Pocahontas, Arkansas.

168,"Antonio Bambocci (1351?–1421?) was an Italian painter and sculptor of the Gothic period, active in and near Naples.

He was born in Peperino, and came to Naples with his father Domenico, also a sculptor. He initially trained with Masuccio, and afterwards by Andrea Ciccione. His masters in painting were Colantino del Fiore and Antonio Solario. He is best known for the sepulchral monuments which he executed, such as those in memory of cardinals Filippo Minutólo and Carbone. In that magnificent one of Lodovico Aldemareschi, which he executed in 1421, an inscription is placed, in which Bambocci calls himself not only a sculptor, but also a painter and brassfounder. The chapel in which this monument was placed was adorned with his pictures. In 1407 he made, by order of cardinal Errico, archbishop of Naples, the architrave and other ornaments of the large door of the cathedral. The doors of the churches of Pappacoda, di St. Agustino alla Zecca, were also executed by him. From his school a great many good artists went forth, such as Angelo Agnello del Fiore and Guglielmo Monaco

Rose states he was born c. 1368 and died about 1435.

169,"Advance Airlines Flight 4210 was a scheduled passenger flight which crashed at Sydney Airport on 21 February 1980, killing all 13 people on board the Advance Airlines Beech Beechcraft King Air 200. After taking off on runway 25 for a scheduled flight the aircraft's left (port) engine failed and the pilot requested an emergency landing on runway 34. The plane crashed into the sea wall while attempting the emergency landing. The accident caused the greatest number of fatalities in a civil aircraft crash in Australia since MacRobertson Miller Airlines Flight 1750, a Vickers Viscount that crashed near Port Hedland in Western Australia on 31 December 1968 killing all 26 on board.

Accident
King Air VH-AAV was operating as Advance Airlines flight DR4210 to Temora and Condobolin, New South Wales with a single pilot and 12 passengers on board. The aircraft commenced takeoff on runway 25 at 1908 hours and, after climbing to a height of no more than , the aircraft was observed to level off and enter a shallow bank to the left. The pilot contacted the control tower advising he had suffered failure of the left engine and requesting an immediate return to land on runway 34. Air Traffic Control acknowledged this request and cleared the King Air to make a visual approach to the runway behind an Ansett Airlines Boeing 727 on final approach.

As VH-AAV continued to turn towards the runway, it descended to just a few feet above the water on a heading towards a sea wall enclosing the runway which stretches into Botany Bay. This manoeuvre prompted the tower controller to enquire if the approach and landing would proceed as normal. The reply from the pilot eight seconds later was ""Alpha Alpha Victor negative"". This was the final transmission from the aircraft. At 1909:08, the Sydney Airport crash alarm system was activated, and the preceding Ansett 727 was instructed to expedite its landing roll and vacate the runway. At 1909:20 VH-AAV was cleared to land but this clearance was not acknowledged. At 1909:22 the aircraft impacted the sea wall  above the waterline. The total duration of the flight was 106 seconds from brakes release to impact. Five fire fighting appliances were dispatched to the accident site and crews extinguished the fire within 10 minutes of the crash.

The initial impact caused the left wing to disintegrate while a section of the right wing, including its engine, separated from the aircraft and came to rest adjacent to the runway. The fuselage was engulfed in an explosion caused by fuel igniting as the wing structures separated. The main wreckage bounced over the sea wall and landed inverted on a taxiway, sliding along the ground for a distance of approximately . All 13 aboard the aircraft were killed in the accident which was ruled to be non-survivable.

Investigation and aftermath
The accident had a profound impact upon the community in the small country town of Temora, as all 12 passengers killed were residents of the surrounding districts. The victims included a local police officer, his wife and one-week-old son who had been airlifted to Sydney five days before the accident as he required urgent medical treatment for a respiratory condition. The family were returning home aboard flight 4210. It was revealed by the Sydney Morning Herald the day following the accident that the state MP for Temora, Jim Taylor, had regularly flown that service on that day of the week, but this particular week had instead flown to Parkes because his wife had been in the area.

The initial accident investigation was conducted by the Air Safety Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport and its report was released in September 1981. While this investigation could not conclusively determine the cause of the accident, a number of conclusions were made about the events leading to the crash. These included the aircraft being heavier than the maximum allowable weight by some  at the time of departure due to a company procedure of using standard (estimated) passenger weights. An amendment had been made to the company's Operations Manual, advising pilots to use a reduced power setting for takeoff to reduce wear on the aircraft engines, but this amendment was not approved by the Department of Transport. When combined with the ambient temperature of  and an overweight aircraft, these factors adversely affected the single pilot's workload and reduced the single-engine performance of the King Air to a critical extent. The investigation determined that the left engine had likely failed due to water contamination of the aircraft's fuel tanks but the source of the contamination was not established.

A board of inquiry, headed by Sir Sydney Frost, was convened on 1 December 1981, sitting over 90 days. On 27 January 1982, the board heard evidence from a former chief pilot of Advance Airlines who told the inquiry that on days when the temperature exceeded  (such as the day of the accident), it would be necessary to use a higher power setting than that advised in the company Operations Manual, and that in his interpretation of the manual this was quite clear. He also told the inquiry that Advance Airlines checked for water in the fuel system each time the aircraft was refuelled. When he operated the aircraft on scheduled flights the day prior to the accident, the aircraft performed ""quite well"". In 1983, the board of inquiry published its findings, attributing the accident to pilot error and the presence of water in the fuel tank, leading to the engine failure. The board of inquiry recommended that commercial aircraft operating in Australia with more than nine passengers should be operated by two pilots. This recommendation was implemented by the Australian aviation regulator.

174,"The short-palated fruit bat (Casinycteris argynnis) is a species of frugivorous megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. Births occur in May.

Description

The head and body of the bat measures from  in length and have a vestigial tail. The forearm length is about . The wing membrane joins with the phalanges of the first toe rather than the second toe as typical in many other fruit bats. The bat weigh anywhere from . The fur is a light brown but the snout, eyelids, ears, and wings can be yellowish green to bright orange in color. The fine hair of the brown fur is brown at its base, lightens in its center, and becomes brown again at the end. At the base of the ears there are tufts of white hairs and two oblong white patches are present between and behind the eyes. The round pupil of the bat is quite large, almost obscuring the yellow-brown iris. The flat nose is pinkish and the ears, as wing membranes, are yellowish-brown. The premolars and molars are abnormally shaped and the spreading zygomatic arches coupled with the ascending ramus indicates a crushing rather than cutting biting mechanism. These characteristics as well as the short and bony palate suggest a radically different diet as compared to typical frugivorous bats, and the short tooth row is typical of an insectivorous rather than frugivorous bat.

Conservation

Though the bat may be locally abundant in Africa, it is threatened by deforestation. The IUCN lists the species as ""Least Concern"" as deforestation is unlikely lead to a major decline in the bat's population.

175,"Typhleotris madagascariensis is a species of fish in the family Milyeringidae that is endemic to Madagascar, where it is only known from underground waters in the southwestern portion of the island. This cavefish is blind and lacks pigmentation, and can reach a standard length of .

This species is known from more than 10 caves and sinkholes in the Mahafaly Plateau region, in places where the water temperature typically ranges from  and the pH is slightly above neutral. Although considered endangered because of its restricted range and not found to be common anywhere in its range in earlier studies, recent surveys found that the species is locally abundant, occurring in especially high numbers in the Andranoilove, Andriamaniloke, Lalia and Mitoho caves. In the southern part of its range, T. madagascariensis co-occurs with T. mararybe, which is not as common or widespread. T. madagascariensis feeds on various invertebrates.

Some of the limestone caves where this fish can be found are protected by the Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, including the Mitoho Grotto tourist site. The IUCN currently assess the species as Endangered but it has stated that further research is necessary on the taxonomic status of different populations of T. madagascarensis as the populations in unconnected cave systems may actually be allopatric species; if this is the case then the IUCN's assessment may require to be changed to Critically Endangered as the range for any individual species will be less than that for  T. madagascarensis sensu lato.

176,"Leeds Dock (formerly New Dock and previously Clarence Dock) is a mixed development with retail, office and leisure presence by the River Aire in central Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It has a large residential population in waterside apartments.

History 
The dock was constructed for boats using the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation to tranship goods and commodities from Leeds city centre in 1843. It was primarily used to bring coal from collieries around Rothwell and Wakefield to supply heavy industries in Hunslet and business and commerce in Leeds city centre.

The western side of the dock once had a large crane on tracks along the side of the dock to load and unload goods from canal barges.  In the 1990s the surrounding area was made up of Victorian industrial buildings most of which were derelict. Throughout the second half of the 20th century the area suffered steady industrial decline. The mills and many heavy engineering works began to close, move further out of town or scale down.
 
Construction of the £42.5 million purpose-built Royal Armouries Museum marked the start of the area's redevelopment which opened in March 1996. No further development was made until 2004 when a multi-storey car park opened followed by an Express hotel in August 2006. The retail and leisure sector was launched on 11 October 2008 with fashion shows from celebrity fashion consultant and TV presenter Gok Wan. However few retail chains were attracted to the area and the site failed to take off as a shopping centre.
 
The site, which had been known as Clarence Dock, became New Dock in mid-2012 as part of a re-branding initiative. The site was bought by Allied London, and rebranded as Leeds Dock in 2013.

Facilities 
Leeds Dock is the home of the Royal Armouries Museum, a major national museum. The site attracts around 1.5 million visitors a year. Although the site was originally intended to include a destination shopping centre, few shops opened and most of the shops that did open have since closed. Leeds Dock's main shopping street, 'The Boulevard'  radiates southbound from Armouries Square. Another focal point is 'The Anchorage' at the top of the dock. Clarence House is a  tower containing 227 apartments and six retail units.

180,"Il Xerse ( in its 1660 French version Xerxès) is an opera by Francesco Cavalli (specifically, a dramma per musica) about Xerxes I. The libretto was written by Nicolò Minato, and was later set by both Giovanni Bononcini (1694, Xerse and George Frideric Handel (Serse, 1738). Minato's plot outline is loosely based on Book 7 of Herodotus's Histories. The opera, Cavalli's twenty-first, consisting of a prologue and three acts, was first performed at Venice on 12 January 1655, at the Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo. It was dedicated to the Ferrarese nobleman Marchese Cornelio Bentivoglio.

Background
The premiere at Venice was probably conducted by Cavalli from the keyboard. The opera was highly popular in Italy, not least due to Cavalli's setting of ""Ombra mai fu"" (later more famously set by Handel): nine different revivals were given across Italy while Cavalli lived.

In 1660 Cavalli was persuaded to travel to France to produce a new opera for the wedding of Louis XIV in Paris. He soon became entangled in court intrigue which ensured that the projected opera, Ercole amante, was not ready in time and had to be replaced by a revival of Xerse at the last minute. Xerse was given with ballets by Cavalli's rival Jean-Baptiste Lully, who had become the official court composer in France. The whole spectacle lasted eight or nine hours and the French audience had little appreciation for an opera in a foreign language, preferring Lully's dance music.

The opera was performed in many different versions. In its Paris form, apart from having the additional ballet suites, the plot was rewritten to make it more congenial to the court, including the enhancement of Xerse himself to a more kingly role comparable to the status of the King of France - which necessitated a change of the register of the part, originally written for a castrato, to a baritone. Many of the recitatives were also rewritten. Surviving manuscripts including Cavalli’s own annotations from performances of Xerse in Venice, Genoa, Naples and Bologna clearly demonstrate that he often amended, cut, and reorganized material as each production was being prepared.

181,"Radar geo-warping is the adjustment of geo-referenced radar images and video data to be consistent with a geographical projection.  This image warping avoids any restrictions when displaying it together with video from multiple radar sources or with other geographical data including scanned maps and satellite images which may be provided in a particular projection.
There are many areas where geo warping has unique benefits:
 Single radar video signal displayed together with maps of different geographical projections. E.g.
Mercator
UTM
stereographic
 Multiple radar video signals displayed simultaneously:
 Having the computing power to do so on one computer.
 Adapting the projection of all radar signals allowing the geographically correct display and accurate superimposition of those videos.
 Slant range correction: a modern 3D radar system can measure the height of a target and hence it is possible to correct the radar video by the real corrected range of the target. Slant Range Correction also allows to compensate the radar tower height e.g. for maritime surveillance radars.

Introduction 
Radar video presents the echoes of electromagnetic waves a radar system has emitted and received as reflections afterwards. These echoes are typically presented on a computer screen with a color-coding scheme depicting the reflection strength.
Two problems have to be solved during such a visualization process. The first problem arises from the fact that typically the radar antenna turns around its position and measures the reflection echo distances from its position in one direction. This effectively means that the radar video data are present in polar coordinates. In older systems the polar oriented picture has been displayed in so called plan position indicators (PPI). The PPI-scope uses a radial sweep pivoting about the center of the presentation. This results in a map-like picture of the area covered by the radar beam. A long-persistence screen is used so that the display remains visible until the sweep passes again.

Bearing to the target is indicated by the target's angular position in relation to an imaginary line extending vertically from the sweep origin to the top of the scope. The top of the scope is either true north (when the indicator is operated in the true bearing mode) or ship's heading (when the indicator is operated in the relative bearing mode).

For visualization on a modern computer screen the polar coordinates have to be converted into Cartesian coordinates. This process called radar scan conversion is presented with more detail in the next section.
The second problem to solve arises from the fact that a radar system is placed in the real world and measures real world echo positions. These echoes have to be displayed together with other real world data like object positions, vector maps and satellite images in a consistent way. All this information refers to the curved earth surface but is displayed on a flat computer display. Building a link from real world earth positions to display pixels is commonly called geographical referencing or in short geo-referencing.

Part of the geo-referencing process is to map the 3D earth surface onto a 2D display. This process of a geographical projection can be performed in many ways, but different data sources have their own 'natural' projection. E.g. Cartesian radar video data from a radar source on the earth surface are geo-referenced by a so-called radar projection. When using this radar projection the Cartesian radar video pixels can directly displayed on a computer screen (only being linearly transformed according to the current position on the screen and e.g. the current zoom level).
A problem now arises if e.g. also a satellite map shall be shown together with the radar video data. The 'natural' geographical projection of a satellite image would be a satellite projection which depends on the satellite orbit, position and further parameters. Now either the satellite image has to be reprojected to a radar projection or the radar video has to use the satellite projection. This geographical re-projection is also called geographical warping or Geo Warping where each image pixel has to be transformed from one projection into another.
This article describes in further detail the Geo Warping of radar video images in real time. It will also show that radar video Geo Warping is done most efficiently when it is integrated with the radar scan conversion process.

Radar-scan conversion 
This section describes the principles of the radar-scan conversion (RSC) process.

The radar supplies its measured data in polar coordinates (ρ,θ) directly from the rotating antenna. ρ defines the target/echo distance and θ the target angle in polar world coordinates. These data are measured, digitized and stored in a polar coordinate polar store or polar pixmap. The main RSC task is to convert these data to Cartesian (x, y) display coordinates, creating the necessary display pixels. The RSC process is influenced by the current zoom, shift and rotation settings defining which part of the 'world' shall be visible in the display image. As detailed later the RSC process also takes the currently used geographical projection into account when the radar video images are Geo Warped.

The OpenGL RSC is implemented using a reverse scan conversion approach which calculates for every image pixel the most appropriate radar amplitude value in the polar store. This approach generates an optimal image without any artifacts known from forward spoke fill algorithms. By applying bi-linear filtering between adjacent pixels in the polar store during the conversion process the OpenGL RSC finally achieves a very high visual quality radar display image for every zoom level, creating smooth images of the radar echoes.

Radar projection 
This section illustrates how radar video data are geo referenced and displayed on a computer screen.

The radar sensor is positioned on the earth surface with a height h above the ground. It measures the direct distance d to the target (and not e.g. the distance the target is away from the radar if one would move on the earth surface). This distance is then used in the display plane after adjustment to the current display zoom level by the radar scan converter (RSC).
Now it has to be clarified how the radar video data is geo referenced. This basically means, that if we want to display a geographical real world object (like e.g. a light house) which is at the same real world position as the radar target, that it also shall appear at the same position in the display plane. This is realized by calculating the distance from the radar sensor to the respective real world object and use that distance in the display plane. The position of the real world object is typically given in geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude and height above the earth surface).
In other words, using a radar projection with geographical data is done by simulating a radar measurement process with the real world objects and use the resulting range and azimuth in the display plane.

The second picture to the right shows an example radar projection with the center of projection (COP) at latitude 50.0° and longitude 0.0° which is also the radar position. The dashed lines are the equal-latitude and equal-longitude lines on top of the background map. The solid lines show equal-range and equal-azimuth with the respect to the radar position. It is a feature of the radar projection that equal-range lines are circles and equal-azimuth lines are straight lines. This is necessary to display radar video consistently with other map data when using a radar projection where the projection center has to be the radar position.

Geo Warping process

This section explains the actual geo warping or re-projection process when applied to radar video in real time.
Assume we want to display radar video on top of a satellite image. As an example we use the CIB projection which is used to display satellite data in CIB (Controlled Image Base) format.

The Figure Geo Warping Radar to CIB Projection shows dashed the maximal range circle for a range of 111 km or 60 miles using the radar projection. Such a range is typical for long range coastal surveillance radars. As stated in the last section this is a perfect circle also on the computer screen. The solid line ellipse shows the same range circle for the CIB projection.

Typically the errors occurring without Geo Warping are smallest near the radar position if at least the projection center (COP) coincides with the radar position, as realized in our example. Otherwise the error distribution depends both on the used projection and also on the projection parameters. Thus, in our case the errors are most significant near the maximum radar range. The CIB projection error corrected in east–west direction at half the radar range is 2.6 km and is 5.3 km at the full radar range of 111 km. An error of 5.3 km is quite significant compared to a typical radial radar measurement resolution of 15 m.

The Figure Coordinate re-projection explains how the radar coordinates have to be transformed to match the CIB projection coordinates. The radar world coordinates correspond to the Cartesian version of the data measured by the radar sensor. Using an inverse radar projection these coordinates are converted into geographic coordinates which represent the radar data posi-tions on the earth surface. These coordinates are then finally projected by the CIB (or any other) projection for displaying on the computer screen.

A problem which arises is that geo warping all measured radar video pixels is far too computing resource consuming as to be performed in real time. A possible solution is to use lookup tables for all points on the screen, but the lookup table re-computation after e.g. a display zoom operation still causes a noticeable delay for radar video visualization.

The Figure Geo warping grid depicts the solution to the problem. The circular radar coverage area is divided into a circular grid. Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points.
As geographical projections are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video display position. Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution makes sure that this is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars such as on ships.

The OpenGL radar-scan converter does its scan conversion computations on the graphics processing unit to achieve high performance and visual quality. The bi-linear coordinate interpolation mentioned above is done in dedicated hardware on the GPU and therefore causes no overhead for the scan converter.

Example 
This example demonstrates how geo warping helps to consistently display multiple radar videos.

This figure shows the visual effects on the right side without geo warping that targets seen by two radars cannot be correctly displayed and it is unclear where the target is actually positioned. The red and yellow target echoes are seen be radars which are about 50 km away. The radars are also about 50 km away from each other. The semi-transparent pink color depicts the track history.

In this scenario even a radar projection is used but of course the radar projection center (COP) can be only at the position of one of the radars. Even larger inconsistencies can arise if a projection different from a radar projection is used. The geo warped view on the left side shows the consistently displayed radar echoes where both radar echoes are exactly at the real target's position.

189,"In enzymology, a kynurenine 7,8-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

kynurenate + AH2 + O2  7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxykynurenate + A

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are kynurenate, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its two products are 7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxykynurenate and the reduction product A.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is  oxidoreductase (hydroxylating). Other names in common use include kynurenic acid hydroxylase, kynurenic hydroxylase, and kynurenate 7,8-hydroxylase.  This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism.

190,"The Diocese of Tournai is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic church in Belgium. The diocese was formed in 1146, upon the dissolution of the Diocese of Noyon & Tournai, which had existed since the 7th Century. It is now suffragan in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels. The cathedra is found within the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Tournai, which has been classified both as a major site for Wallonia's heritage since 1936 and as a World Heritage Site since 2000.

History

As early as the second half of the 3rd century St. Piat evangelized Tournai; some sources name him as the first bishop, but this remains unsubstantiated. At the end of the 3rd century Emperor Maximian rekindled persecutions, and St. Piat was martyred as a result.

Barbarian invasions began shortly afterwards. These lasted from the end of the 3rd century till the end of the 5th century.  St. Remigius used the good-will of the Frankish monarchy to organize the Catholic hierarchy in the North of Gaul. He confided the Diocese of Arras and Cambrai to St. Vaast (Vedastus), and founded the See of Tournai (c. 500), appointing as its titular Eleutherius.

It was probably its status of royal city which secured Tournai's early rise, only to lose its position as capital upon the departure of the Merovingian court. Nevertheless, it maintained its own bishops for nearly a century. Then, at about 626 or 627, under the episcopate of St. Achar, the sees of Tournai and Noyon were reunited, retaining however their separate structures. Tournai lost its privileges and was relegated to level of the neighbouring dioceses, such as Boulogne and Therouanne, Arras and Cambrai. The same ordinary held both sees for five hundred years. It was only in 1146 that Tournai received its own bishop.
 

Notable bishops are: St. Eleutherius (beginning of 6th century); St. Achar (626/27 – 1 March 637/38); St. Eloi (641–660); Simon de Vermandois (1121–1146); Walter de Marvis (1219–1251), the great founder of schools and hospitals; Etienne of Tournai (1192–1203), godfather of Louis VII of France and minister to the queen; Andrea Chini Malpiglia (1334–42), cardinal and papal legate; Guillaume Fillastre (1460–1473), chancellor of the Golden Fleece; Michel de Warenghien (1283–1291), a very erudite doctor; Michel d'Esne (1597–1614), the author of several works.

During Spanish rule (1521–1667) the see continued to be occupied by natives of the country, but the seize of Tournai by Louis XIV in 1667 caused it to have a number of Frenchmen for bishop: Gilbert de choiseul duplessis praslin (1670–1689); François de La Salle de Caillebot (1692–1705); Louis Marcel de Coëtlogon (1705–1707); François de Beauveau (1708–1713). After the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) the French were replaced by Germans: Johann Ernst, Count of Löwenstein-Wertheim (1713–1731); Franz Ernst, Count of Salm-Reifferscheid (1731–1770); Wilhelm Florentine, Prince of Salm-Salm (1776–1794).

The reunion of the see with Noyon and the ensuing removal of the seat of the bishopric bolstered the chapter. The chapter's requirement to appoint only nobility and scholars, as set forth by the old régime, tended to attract the highly born and educated. Illustrious French and Belgian names are inscribed in the archive's registers and on the cathedral's tombstones. The cathedral,  long by  wide, is surmounted by 5 towers  high. The nave and transept are Romanesque (12th century), while the choir is primary Gothic, begun in 1242 and completed in 1325.

Originally, the borders of the diocese arguably were those of the Civitas Turnacensium, as mentioned in the ""Notice des Gaules"". The prescriptions of councils and the interest of the Church both favoured such borders, and they were retained throughout the Middle Ages. The diocese then further extended along the left bank of the river Schelde, from the river Scarpe to the North Sea, with the exception of the Vier-Ambachten (Hulst, Axel, Bouchaute, and Assenede), which are said to have always belonged to the Diocese of Utrecht. The Schelde thus formed the natural border between the Dioceses of Tournai and Cambrai, cutting through the towns of Termonde, Ghent, Oudenarde, and Tournai itself. The North Sea seaboard between the Schelde and the Yser was wholly part of this perimeter. On the far side of the Yser resided the Diocese of Thérouanne, which bordered Tournai as far as Ypres. There began the Diocese of Arras, which bordered Tournai as far as the confluence of the Scarpe and the Schelde at Mortgne, France. This vast diocese was for a long time divided into three archdeaneries and twelve deaneries. The archdeanery of Bruges comprised the deaneries of Bruges, Ardenbourg, and Oudenbourg; the archdeanery of Ghent, the deaneries of Ghent, Roulers, Oudenarde, and Waes; the archdeanery of Tournai, the deaneries of Tournai, Seclin, Helchin, Lille, and Courtrai.

In 1559, to support the war against Protestantism, King Philip II of Spain obtained from Paul IV the foundation of a series of new dioceses. The ancient Diocese of Tournai was split up, with nearly two-thirds of its territory being cut away. The outlines of the archdeaneries of Bruges and Ghent formed the new diocese of Bruges and diocese of Ghent, and six parishes passed to the new diocese of Ypres. This situation lasted until the beginning of the 19th century. The French Revolution created the Department of Jemappes, which in 1815 became the Province of Hainaut, whose borders coincided with those of the Diocese of Tournai, after a concordat between the plenipotentiaries of Pius VI and the consular government of the republic. The Bishop of Tournai retained only two scores of the parishes formerly under his jurisdiction, but received on the right bank of the Schelde a number of parishes which, prior to the Revolution, had belonged to the Diocese of Cambrai (302), Namur (50), and Liège (50).

192,"Richard Andrews (1798–1859) was a prominent industrialist, philanthropist and politician in Southampton.

Richard Andrews was born the son of a wheelwright at Bishop's Sutton. He founded his own coachbuilding business, with a manufacturing site in Above Bar.

He was well-known and respected for his work for the city, and was elected mayor in 1849, for three consecutive years, and again in 1856.

East (Andrews) Park in Southampton is named after him, and features his statue. The original statue, erected in 1860, was a much grander affair, but the limestone weathered poorly, and the pedestal was replaced in 1971.

The full text on the plaque on his statue reads:
Born the son of a wheelwright at Bishop's Sutton, Hampshire he became a coachbuilder of international fame. His manufactory in above Bar was one of the town's leading industries. Five times Mayor of Southampton he was known for his generosity and energy in furthering the prosperity of the town. A good employer, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to promoting the self-reliance of the working man. This statue was erected in 1860 and the pedestal reconstructed in 1971.

196,"The Anne Arundel County Sheriff's Office (AASO) is the law enforcement arm of the court, serving the citizens of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. All deputy sheriffs are certified law enforcement officials with full authority of arrest.

History
The AASO was organized in 1650. John Norwood was appointed the first Sheriff and was paid in pounds of tobacco for services rendered (e.g., serving any writ such as a warrant, tending prisoners, collecting taxes, etc.). In 1776, with the formation of the Maryland Constitution, the Sheriff became an elected position with an initial term lasting one year. The term was then changed to three years, then two, and finally four years in 1926 where it remains today.

Duties
The duties of the AASO are to enforce writs of the court, maintain the county warrants, extradite prisoners from foreign jurisdictions, transport prisoners between holding facilities and the courts, and maintain courtroom decorum. The AASO is also charged with assisting other law enforcement agencies as needed.

Organization
The current Sheriff is Jim Fredericks, serving his first term.

The AASO is divided into two bureaus:
the Security Bureau headed by Capt. LaPlanche. The Security Bureau is responsible for courtroom security, holding prisoners, and transporting prisoners.
the Operations Bureau headed by Capt. Gilbert-Duran. The Operations Bureau is responsible for Sheriff communications, serving writs of the court (e.g., protective orders, peace orders, criminal summons, landlord & tenant orders, warrants, etc.)

Fallen officers 

Since the establishment of the Anne Arundel County Sheriff's Office, one officer has died while on duty.

198,"was a Tokugawa general and chief retainer at the end of the Sengoku and start of the Edo period. He was the father of Aoyama Tadatoshi, and the Aoyama region of Shibuya is named after him.

History
The Aoyama clan were provincial lords of Dōdo village, Nukata District in Mikawa Province (present Okazaki, Aichi). Aoyama Tadakado, Tadanari's father, served both Matsudaira Hirotada and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and thus Tadanari served near Ieyasu since he was young. In 1572, his father died in battle with Takeda Shingen and Tadanari inherited the estate.

Tadanari was highly trusted by Ieyasu, and in 1585 he commanded him to guard his son Hidetada. In 1588, Tadanari accompanied Hidetada to the capital where he was granted Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade of Hitachi Province by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1590 Ieyasu relocates to Kantō and promotes Tadanari to magistrate of Edo with lands worth 5,000 koku (increased by 2,000 koku in 1593). His estates centered on Harajuku village and extended from part of Akasaka to Shibuya. Present day Aoyama is so named because one of Tadanari's mansions was located there. 

In 1600, Tadanari joined Hidetada's army at the Battle of Sekigahara and obtained 15,000 koku of lands between Kazusa Province and Shimōsa Province. In addition to being the Edo magistrate, he also served as the general magistrate for the entire Kantō region. After the start of the Edo shogunate, he was heavily involved in shogunate policy along with Honda Masanobu and Naitō Kiyonari. Along with Naitō in 1606, he is temporarily sentenced to house arrest but is soon pardoned.

Primarily specialising in track cycling, Rasmussen was also proficient in road racing, winning the Danish National Road Race Championships in 2007.

Career
He was the 2005 Scratch World Champion. Together with Michael Mørkøv, Rasmussen won the Danish Madison Championships six times in a row, and as such, are nicknamed the 'Par nummer syv' (Pair number seven).

His previously signed contract with  for the 2012 season, nullified upon news of the whereabouts violations, was again honored. The UCI appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December 2011, with the original decision being overturned on 4 July 2012.

On 19 March 2013,  re-signed Rasmussen for the remainder of the 2013 season. Rasmussen left  following the 2013 season, and subsequently announced plans to re-enter track cycling. Rasmussen joined  for the 2014 season.

205,"Sir Subbier Subramania Iyer  (; 1 October 1842 – 5 December 1924) was an Indian lawyer, jurist and freedom fighter who, along with Annie Besant, founded the Home Rule Movement. He was popularly known as the ""Grand Old Man of South India"".

On completion of his schooling in Madurai, Subramania Iyer qualified as a lawyer and went on to practice as a lawyer in Madurai and Madras, before being appointed a Judge of the Madras High Court, in 1891. He also served as the first Indian Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, before retiring in 1907.

Early life and education

Subramania Iyer was born in Madurai in the Madras Presidency, British India on 1 October 1842. His father Sooravally Subbier Aiyer (1794–1844) was the legal agent of the Raja of Ramnad's zamindari, but died when Subramania Iyer was barely two years old. He had his early education at the English Mission School, Madurai, joining the Zilla School, Madurai, in 1856, from which institution he completed his schooling.

As his mother was not willing to send him to Madras for a higher education, Subramania Iyer decided to join the administrative service. He served as a clerk in the Deputy Collector's Office, Madurai, Deputy Collector's Office, Ramnad, and the Collector's Office, Madurai. While working in the Collector's Office, he studied privately for the Pleader's Examination and stood first among the successful candidates.

Though unable to secure a 'Sanad' to practice, he was appointed the Public Prosecutor, when the Criminal Penal Code came into force, in 1862. Desiring to practice as a lawyer, he studied privately for the Matriculation Examination and passed the same in 1865, followed by the First Arts (F.A.) examination in 1866. Two years later, in 1868, he passed the B.L. examination from Presidency College, Madras, standing first (in the Second Class) among all successful candidates. He served as an apprentice under J. C. Mill, Barrister-at-Law, and thus qualified himself to practice as a Vakil.

Professional career
Practising as a Vakil at Madura from 1869 to 1885, he appeared in some important cases, the most notable among them being the Ramnad Zamindar's Case and the Meenakshi Temple Funds Misappropriation Case. While at Madura, he also earned a reputation as a public worker, being appointed a Municipal Commissioner of Madura and a member of the Local Board, besides being elected a member of the Devasthanam Committee of the Meenakshi Temple at Madura.

He presented an 'Address of Welcome', on behalf of the people of Madura, to the Prince of Wales, who visited Madura in 1875. In 1877, he gave evidence and pleaded for the necessity of protecting tenants from arbitrary eviction by the landlords, before the Famine Commission when it visited Madura. He also served as the Vice-Chairman of the Madura Municipality, from 1882 until his departure for Madras.""

After his wife, Lakshmi's death in 1884, he shifted to Madras, where he emerged as a formidable rival to the redoubtable lawyers Bhashyam Aiyangar and Eardley Norton. Recognising his merit, the Government appointed him Government Pleader and Public Prosecutor in 1888, the first Indian to be appointed so. As Government Pleader, he appeared in two sensational cases – the Nageswara Iyer Forgery Case and the Tirupati Mahant Case. He was appointed an Acting Judge in 1891 and continued in that position until being appointed a Judge of the Madras High Court in January 1895, succeeding Sir Muthuswamy Iyer to the bench of that Court.

As Judge, amongst other cases, he presided over the insolvency court which investigated into the crash of a Madras bank, Arbuthnot & Co, in 1906. He also acted as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in 1899, 1903 and 1906, the first Indian to do so. After serving as a judge of the Madras High Court for 12 years, he resigned on 13 November 1907 due to failing sight, and was succeeded by Mr. Chettur Sankaran Nair.

He presented the Welcome Address to the Prince of Wales, in 1914, on behalf of the public of Madras.

Political career 

Subramania Iyer was nominated a member of the Legislative Council of Madras by the Government, in 1884 and left a creditable record as a non-official member of the Council although the rules did not permit non-official members to play a very useful role. Serving as a member of the Malabar Land Tenure Committee (1885), largely due to his initiative, an act was passed providing compensation for tenants' improvement in Malabar. Nominated for a second time, Subramania Iyer made his association with the council as useful as possible under the system extant then.

One of the founding members of the Indian National Congress, he led the Madras delegation to its first session at Bombay, in December 1885, where he seconded a resolution proposed by K. T. Telang urging the increase of the elected element in the Legislative Councils and for councillors to be given real and effective powers, and where he made the following statement, as published in the annals of the Indian National Congress of 1885:

He used to attend sessions of the Congress until he became a Judge of the High Court and contributed in no small measure to the strengthening of the Congress's organisation in the Madras Presidency.

He was close to Sir Arthur Lawley, whom he is held to have substantially influenced and assisted in his administration of the Madras Presidency, in a private capacity.

As Chairman of the Reception Committee, he welcomed the delegates to the 29th session of the Indian National Congress held at Madras in 1914. He presided over a public meeting at Madras in 1915 organised to welcome Mr. M. K. Gandhi just then returned from South Africa. Welcoming Mr. Gandhi, he suggested the lines on which national work in India should proceed:

He agreed to serve as the Honorary President of the All India Home Rule League established in Madras on 1 September 1916, by Mrs. Annie Besant, whose arrest was ordered on 16 June 1917, by Lord Pentland, Governor of Madras. As President of the League, he took up the cause of Mrs. Besant and her colleagues and started a movement for their release, which occasioned his rupture with the Government.

Immediately after Mrs. Besant was interned, Sir Subramania Iyer wrote a letter to Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America describing British Rule in India and appealing for the sympathy and support of the American Government and people, in which he stated:

Subjected to scathing criticism in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the Secretary of State, Edwin Montagu, and the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, rebuked him when he met them in Madras in 1918 to make a representation on the proposed political reforms. A few days later, Sir Subramania Iyer renounced his knighthood and returned the insignia to the Government.

Academic interests and career 
His interest in the scholarly aspects of law led to his residence, the Beach House on the Marina at Mylapore, being used for the ""Saturday Club"" that met at 11 a. m. every week, between 1888 and 1891, with all leading members of the Madras Bar participating, and cases being critically analysed. At one of these meetings it was decided to start 'The Madras Law Journal', which was inspired by the then recently established periodicals the 'Law Quarterly Review', started by Sir Frederick Pollock in England in 1885 and 'The Harvard Law Review' established by the Harvard Law School Association in 1887.

During his tenure as Judge of the Madras High Court he introduced the practice of referring to American jurisprudence in addition to the English, which had been the sole point of reference until then.

He was nominated Senator of the Madras University in 1885 and continued to be connected with that institution till 1907. As a member of the Senate, he advanced many reforms in education. He was a member of the Syndicate for the University for some time and was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1896.

The Madras University conferred on him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Law in 1908, making him the first recipient of an honorary degree from the University. He presided over the Madras Students' Convention in 1916 and delivered the Presidential Address. He also served as the Chairman of the Council of Native Education for two years. He delivered a series of lectures at Madras University on Ancient Indian Polity, in 1914 which were published in 1916.

He extended his co-operation to Mrs. Besant in the establishment of the Central Hindu College at Benares which subsequently became the nucleus of the Benares Hindu University.

Cultural interests 
He was the President of the Dharma Rakshana Sabha, which he founded in 1908, and which sought to prevent the mismanagement of the funds of Hindu Religious Endowment and Charitable Trusts. He also worked for the promotion of Sanskritic study, and established two schools for Vedic Studies in Madura and Thiruparankundram. As the President of the Suddha Dharma Mandala, which he founded, he was instrumental in publishing several important Hindu religious works.

Having been greatly interested in spirituality and the study of religion he became interested in the Theosophical Society which he formally joined soon after his retirement. He was also the Vice-President of the Theosophical Society between 1907 and 1911.

As one of the prominent members his literary contributions were a regular feature of the Theosophical Society's publication The Theosophist right up to the 1920s. His participation in the activities of the Theosophical Society gradually drew him closer to Annie Besant and the Indian independence movement.

The Suddha Dharma Mandala or 'Pure Religion Society' resulted in a rift between himself and the Theosophical Society, since he desired to provide a rival world leader to Jiddu Krishnamurti, the favoured champion of the Society.

Honours 
The Government awarded a Certificate of Merit to Subramania Iyer on 1 January 1877 as a mark of their appreciation of his services to the public, on the occasion of the Proclamation Durbar at Delhi.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire, in 1890, and was elevated to a Knight-Commander of the same order on New Year's Day, 1900.

In 1893, he had the title of Dewan Bahadur conferred upon him.

Death and progeny 
He died on 5 December 1924 and was survived by three sons borne to him by his wife Lakshmi.

Legacy 
The Mani Iyer Hall in Triplicane was built by the Theosophists in his memory and named after him. He is also commemorated by a statue, unveiled in 1935, outside the Senate House of the Madras University.

206,"Pat ""the Cope"" Gallagher (; born 10 March 1948) is a former Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 2016 to 2020, Minister of State for Health Promotion and Food Safety from 2007 to 2008, Minister of State for Environmental Protection from 2002 to 2007, Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht from 1993 to 1994, Minister of State for Gaeltacht Affairs from 1989 to 1993, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine from 1987 to 1989 and 1992 to 1993. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1981 to 1997, 2002 to 2009 and 2016 to 2020. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 to 2002 and from 2009 to 2014.

Background
Gallagher was born in Burtonport, a fishing port in The Rosses in the west of County Donegal. He is the grandson of Paddy 'the Cope' Gallagher, of the Irish Co-Operative movement. He was educated at Dungloe Secondary School – Rosses Community School, Coláiste Éinde in Salthill and at University College, Galway (UCG), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1970. He worked as a fish exporter until 1982, becoming involved in local politics in 1979.

Family
His middle name 'The Cope' refers to his family connection to The Cope agricultural cooperative which operates in The Rosses area of west Donegal. This name is used in his profile on the Fianna Fáil website and on the European Parliament website. Gallagher was a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and also serves as Chairman of the delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.

Gallagher's wife, Ann Gillespie, and her sister, Eibhlin, both served almost 10 years of a 15-year sentence for conspiracy and explosive charges. In 1974, the sisters were visiting a house in Manchester when a bomb being made there exploded.

Gillespie maintains her innocence, saying police used evidence from a discredited scientist, Frank Skuse, but does not wish to reopen the case. In 2005, Gillespie's solicitor Gareth Peirce stated that she believed the case could have been successfully re-opened.

Political career
Gallagher was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1981 general election, retaining his seat until retiring at the 1997 general election. Gallagher was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Marine from 12 March 1987 to 12 July 1988. He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht in July 1987, serving in that post until 11 February 1992 and again in the same post from 13 February 1992 until 12 January 1993. He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1993.

In 1994, he was elected to the European Parliament as an MEP for the Connacht–Ulster constituency, and was re-elected at the 1999 European Parliament election. During his period in Europe, Gallagher was a member of a number of committees including Fisheries, Economics and Monetary and Industry and Energy.

He returned to domestic politics to successfully contest the 2002 general election, and was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government in June 2002. In Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's cabinet reshuffle in 2004, he received the portfolio of Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government and at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources from 29 September 2004 to 14 February 2006. Following a period in this role, Gallagher was moved to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport from 14 February 2006 where he served until 14 June 2007. From 20 June 2007 to 12 May 2008, he served as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for Health Promotion and Food Safety. He was not re-appointed to the government after Brian Cowen became Taoiseach in May 2008.

He was elected as an MEP for the North-West constituency at the 2009 European Parliament election. Immediately thereafter, Gallagher replaced Brian Crowley as the head of Fianna Fáil's European delegation; this promotion came in the aftermath of Crowley publicly attacking the party's decision to join the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party. Gallagher was a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries.

In addition to being a serving politician in Europe, he receives annual pension payments of €70,562 a year from his time as a TD and junior minister. He has stated that he donates the entire amount to charitable causes.

Gallagher lost his seat at the 2014 European Parliament election.

In the 2016 general election, after a redrawing of constituency boundaries, he ran alongside Charlie McConalogue as the two Fianna Fáil candidates in the new five-seater Donegal constituency. Gallagher was elected on the 11th count, after McConalogue was elected on the first count. He lost his seat at the February 2020, with Pádraig Mac Lochlainn winning back the seat Gallagher had won at his expense in 2016.

209,"6805 Abstracta, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous Themistian asteroid and slow rotator from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 10 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named for the astronomical bibliography Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts.

Orbit and classification 

Abstracta is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,080 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1949, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 11 years prior to its discovery.

The survey designation ""P–L"" stands for ""Palomar–Leiden"", named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.

A rotational lightcurve of Abstracta was obtained at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory from photometric observation made in September 2011. It showed an exceptionally long rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.78 in magnitude ().

Diameter and albedo 

According to the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Abstracta measures 11.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of 0.09. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a typical albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.08 and calculates a somewhat smaller diameter of 8.4 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 13.74.

Naming 

This minor planet was named for the astronomical bibliography Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts (AAA).

Since it was founded under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union in 1969, it has systematically described, documented and indexed more than half a millions astronomical and astrophysical documents and produced more than 60 volumes. Head of AAA was German astronomer Lutz Schmadel, also known for his Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, and after whom the minor planet 2234 Schmadel is named. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 June 1996 .

210,"Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 1st Baronet (10 October 1717 – 20 July 1807), also 11th of Duntreath, was a Scottish politician.

Born at Dumbarton, Silver Banks, he was the son of Archibald Edmonstone, 10th of Duntreath, and his wife Anne Campbell (d. Ireland, 2 November 1785, paternal granddaughter of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll and maternal granddaughter of John Elphinstone, 8th Lord Elphinstone and sister of the John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll). He was Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland from 1763 to 1765. He succeeded his father in 1768. By the time of his inheritance he was Member of Parliament for the Dumbartonshire, to which seat he was elected in 1761, 1768, and 1774. In 1780 he was chosen for Ayr Burghs but was again Member for Dumbartonshire in 1790, and continued to hold this office until he retired from Parliament in 1799.  A staunch Tory supporter, he upheld Lord North's government during the American War of Independence, and due to his public services, he was created a baronet on 20 May 1774.

Edmonstone married firstly October 1753, Susanna Mary Harenc (d. 4 July 1776), daughter of Roger Harenc (d. 10 June 1763), a French gentleman from Paris who had settled in England around 1720, and wife Susanna Hays. They had five sons and three daughters. Secondly he married Hester, daughter of Sir John Heathcoate, who died without children in 1797. Edmonstone, having lived to be eighty nine, died in his house in Argyll Street in London in July 1807. His five sons all had distinguished careers; however, since his two eldest sons had predeceased him, he was succeeded by his third son Charles.

212,"Borderline tree is a term used in forestry.

It is a concept that comes from variable radius plots, or point sampling.  It happens when a tree cannot be easily determined as in or out when using a prism or angle gauge.  Borderline trees occur only when the distance from the sampling point to the center of the tree is equal to the DBH times plot radius factor (PRF).  The PRF is determined based on the type of prism or angle gauge being used.  Basal Area Factor (BAF) 5, 10, and 20 angle gauges result in PRFs of 3.89, 2.75, and 1.94 (feet inch−1) respectively. The metric equivalents of these PRFs are 0.467, 0.33, and 0.233 (m cm−1).

When a tree is borderline, a series of measurements and calculations must be made to determine if the tree is in or out. The horizontal distance from the sampling point to the center of the tree must be measured along with the DBH of the tree.  The DBH should then be multiplied by the PRF, which will give a limiting distance.  If the measured distance is less than or equal to this limiting distance, the tree is counted as in.  If it is greater than the limiting distance, it is out.

Units
BAF: ft2/acre, (metric: m2/ha)

PRF: ft/inch, (metric: m/cm)

Formulas

Limiting Distance = DBH x PRF

PRF = ,   metric:

Example
A tree that appears borderline using a BAF 10 instrument was measured  as  DBH.  
The horizontal distance from the sampling point to the center of the tree is .
DBH x PRF = Limiting Distance
12.4in. x 2.75ft./in. = 34.1ft.
34.1 feet (limiting distance) is greater than 34 feet (measured distance), tree is in.

214,"René-Nicolas Dufriche, baron Desgenettes (23 May 1762, Alençon – 3 February 1837, Paris) was a French military doctor.  He was chief doctor to the French army in Egypt and at Waterloo.

Life

Early life
Son of a lawyer at the Parliament of Rouen, he first studied at the Jesuit college at Alençon.  He studied classics at Collège Sainte-Barbe and the Collège du Plessis in Paris, but left off these studies to follow the course taught at the collège de France, from then on studying medicine with devotion.  Trained in the hospital services of Pelletan and Vicq d’Azyr, he also studied under John Hunter in London and Desbois de Rochefort and Boyer in France.  In trying to perfect his skills he made several journeys to England and Italy (spending 4 years at Florence and Siena then Rome and Naples), where his good manners brought him the acquaintance of many of the most distinguished scholars of the day.

Returning to France in the course of 1789, he was made a doctor at Montpellier, in the wake of his remarkable thesis entitled : Essai physiologique sur les vaisseaux lymphatiques (Physiological essay on the lymphatic vessels).

Revolution and Italy
In 1791, he went to Paris, where political unrest was at its height.  He joined the Girondins and then, on their elimination by the Montagnards during the Reign of Terror, he took refuge in Rouen.  The events of 1792 and early 1793 had caused the whole of Europe to take up arms against France and so, on the advice of his former teacher Vicq-d’Azyr and driven by a desire to serve the Republican fatherland, he got himself sent as a surgeon to the army gathering on the borders of Italy in February 1793.  He soon became one of the top army surgeons through his energy and courage, and in March 1793 was attached to the field hospital of the armée de la Méditerranée due to his knowing Italian.

In effect, during this first campaign, always at the advanced outposts, he was involved in the reorganisation of French military hospitals.  In the Armée d'Italie from 1793 to 1795, he got to know Napoleon Bonaparte and dazzled him with his intelligence and his range of cultural awareness.  A few years later, Bonaparte remembered him and made him chief doctor to the Egyptian expedition.  Attached to the division commanded by general Masséna, he successfully faced a typhus epidemic.

After Italy
On 24 nivôse year II, he took up leadership of the hospital at Antibes, all of whose patients were cured, and returned to the army on 30 fructidor to be head of the hospital service of the right division, then moved to Loano and the representatives there, on 2 nivôse year III, to organise the medical service for the maritime expedition assigned to reconquer Corsica (taken by the English).  After this expedition, he rejoined the active army at Albenga, where he learned that on Barras's request and Bonaparte's recommendation he had on 7 brumaire year IV been made ""médecin ordinaire"" of the hospital of Val-de-Grâce and of the 17e division militaire (Paris). A year later he became professor of physiology and medical physics.

The following year Bonaparte, who had appreciated Desgenettes' merit, reiterated it to the Directory and tried to get them to get him attached to his army.  However, in a fit of jealousy, the directeurs kept Desgenettes in Paris, under the pretext that he could be more use to the Republic in a medical school rather than serving with the field hospitals.  It was thus during this period of rest that Desgenettes edited his mémoire on the usefulness of artificial anatomical models.  In this, after tracing their history and giving details of the magnificent collection of them at Florence, he called on the French government to found a similar institution in Paris.  Shortly after the Revolution, he frequented the salon of Anne-Catherine Helvétius.  Nevertheless, for Charles Mullié, it was painful to say that, in his roles as professor, Desgenettes the scholar's only reward for his sacrificing his fortune and his own health by indifference and ingratitude - four times in floréal year V he rendered his resignation, and four times the ministry refused to accept it.

Egypt
On returning to Paris after the Treaty of Campo Formio, Bonaparte obtained his protégé Desgenettes an attachment to the armée d'Angleterre on 23 nivôse year VI ; it is now known that the organisation of this army on the Channel coast was only a cover for preparations for the French invasion of Egypt.  Also, on 1 pluviôse, Desgenettes received the order to report to Toulon, to be attached to general Bonaparte's army as doctor in chief.  In 1798, he was made chief physician of the Armée d'Orient as well as part of the natural history and physics section of the Institut d'Égypte, and Bonaparte invited him on board the admiral's flagship Orient.

As physician in chief, Desgenettes instructed the health officers of the Armée d'Orient (i.a. Antonio Savaresi) to study the ecology, the diseases and the remedies used by local healers. Desgenettes had hardly arrived in Egypt when he was assailed by the several diseases brought on the army by the burning heat, continual bivouacing and lack of drinkable water.  He installed hygiene measures and rigorous preventative measures - washing (both bodies and clothes), disinfection of areas, supervision of nutrition.  The many cases of smallpox, scurvy, ""fièvre de Damiette"", severe and contagious conjunctivitis and dysentery observed by him here gave him further experience of military medicine.  During the expedition into Syria, as head doctor of the armée d’Orient, Desgenettes had to face a bubonic plague epidemic in the course of the army's march across Syria's desert.  To  sustain the troops' morale, he denied the disease's existence and forbade any mention of its name.

When Bonaparte found himself forced to raise the siege of the fortress at Saint-Jean-d'Acre on 21 May 1799, he demanded that the medical staff evacuate the wounded and ill and kill the plague cases with fatally strong doses of opium, but Desgenettes determinedly refused to do so, forcing Bonaparte to instead transport them as far as Jaffa.  The two men's friendship then cooled again over the question of evacuating the plague cases from Jaffa.

Return to France
On returning to France, around the end of Fructidor year IX, Desgenettes was designated as head doctor of the military training-hospital of Strasbourg.  However, due to his new role as professor adjoined to the École de Médecine de Paris and his need for stability after a punishing campaign, he begged the favour of instead continuing as doctor to the hospital at Val-de-Grâce.  Napoleon approved this request, on 8 Nivôse year X.  Made a member of the Institut and an associate member of the Sociétés de médecine of Marseille and of Montpellier that same year, around the start of year XI he published his Histoire médicale de l’armée d’Orient, creating a great sensation in the scholarly world.

Made a member of the Légion d’honneur on 25 prairial (14 June) year XII, on the day after the proclamation of the First French Empire he was made inspector-general of the Army Health Service (Service de Santé des Armées).  In year XIII, he then became a member of the commission sent to Tuscany by Napoleon to study the character of the epidemic raging there, and in year XIV he then went to Spain with other French doctors to carry out research on yellow fever.  He re-assumed his duties at Val-de-Grâce in January 1806.

War
Since hostilities had recommenced, the exertions of three consecutive campaigns had introduced several diseases into the French army.  On 6 April 1807, Desgenettes received the emperor's order to rejoin the grand quartier général ; his only son was dying, but he stopped caring for him and left with 24 hours.  In 1807, he was made chief doctor of the Grande Armée and in this role assisted at the battles of Eylau, Friedland and Wagram.  After the peace of Tilsitt, he asked to return to private life and devote himself wholly to his family, but Napoleon refused.  He was allowed a vacation, leaving Berlin for Paris in May 1808, and returning to Napoleon in October, by which time he was in Spain, where he judged Desgenettes' presence to be necessary.

Loaded with favours from Napoleon but despairing at the curbs set by his army work on his liberty and independence, he was made a knight of the empire in 1809, then a baron in 1810.  Taking part in the Russian campaign, he organised the care of the officers.  Taken prisoner at Vilnius on 10 December 1812 during the retreat from Russia, he was the only one captured that day mentioned by name as worth being freed.  Tsar Alexander I of Russia freed him when he heard of the care he had taken of Russian soldiers and had him escorted by his Cossack guard to the French forward-lines at Magdeburg on 20 March 1813.  Desgenettes set out from there for Paris, charged with a secret mission from the viceroy to Napoleon, which he acquitted.  In the course of April he then left Paris again to reassume his duties as head-doctor of the Grande Armée.

He was trapped in the citadel of Torgau after the defeat at Leipzig during the campaign in Germany.  A typhus epidemic was raging in the citadel at the time, and he was still holed up there when an imperial decree of 5 October 1813 made him chief-doctor of the Imperial Guard, which circumstances thus preventing him from taking up immediately.  On the site's capitulation on 2 January 1814, he wished to return to France but was instead, in disregard for the treaties, held back in Dresden as a prisoner.  It was only at the end of May that he could return to Paris, where he found that minister Dupont de l’Étang had withdrawn his title as chief-doctor to the Guard.  Alongside these persecutions on the part of the military administration, he was also ejected from his chair of hygiene at the Faculté de médecine de Paris, given him by the consulate in reward for his services at Saint-Jean-d'Acre.  To make up for these injustices, he was made a knight of the Légion d'honneur.  On acceding to the ministry, Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult returned to Desgenettes his roles as chief-doctor and professor at the hospital of Val-de-Grâce and Napoléon, on his return, reinstated him as chief inspector of the health service and as chief doctor of the Guard, adding on 20 May an appointment as chief doctor of the armée du Nord.

Hundred Days and after
During the Hundred Days, Desgenettes re-assumed his role as chief-doctor of the Imperial Guard and assisted at the Battle of Waterloo.

He came back to Paris with the army, and Louis XVIII confirmed him in his role at Val-de-Grâce on 1 July and at the Faculté de Médecine in Paris, where he was charged with teaching hygiene and readmitted into the Conseil général de Santé des armées in 1819 (formerly the Inspection générale).  He only gave up his roles as inspector-general in January 1816, when the title was suppressed.

In 1820, he was received as a member of the Académie Royale de Médecine, though he was expelled in 1822 following student demonstrations, only to be re-admitted in 1830 and elected a member of the Académie des sciences under the July Monarchy.

After the July Revolution, on 14 November, Baron Desgenettes was made mayor of the 10th arrondissement of Paris, a role he filled until the municipal elections of 1834.

On 2 March 1832, he was made chief doctor of Les Invalides. His name features on the Arc de Triomphe. He was also a member of the Académie de Caen.

Alexandre Dumas described Desgenettes as ""old, bawdy, very witty and very cynical"".

217,", commonly called the Powley ruling, is a Supreme Court of Canada case defining Métis Aboriginal rights under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.

Background
A Sault Ste. Marie father and son, Steve and Roddy Powley, were charged in 1993 with possession of a moose that they had shot out of season and without a licence. The pair pleaded not guilty on the grounds that as Métis, they had an Aboriginal right to hunt that was not subject to Ontario game laws.

Procedural history
The Ontario Court of Justice agreed and dismissed the charges. The Ontario Attorney General appealed that decision to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which upheld the acquittals and denied the appeal. 

The Ontario Attorney General appealed again, to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which also upheld the acquittals and denied the appeal. Finally, Ontario appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, where a unanimous court upheld the decisions of the lower courts and defined a ten-step test for Métis rights, based on modified tests from the previous Indian Aboriginal rights decisions in R. v. Sparrow and R. v. Van der Peet.

Aftermath
Métis people seeking to exercise Aboriginal rights of hunting and fishing must show that the practice in question relates to the practice of a rights-bearing Métis community prior to European political and legal control and that they are members of the corresponding modern Métis community by both self-identification and acceptance within the community.

Thus, if a Métis group of people established a rights-bearing community distinct from any Indian or Inuit Aboriginal groups from which it had descended, practices that the community exercised prior to European control may be Section 35(1) rights.

218,"The Ernest Street Sewage Pumping Station is an historic wastewater pumping station at Ernest and Ellis Streets near the wastewater treatment facility at Field's Point in Providence, Rhode Island.  The surviving elements of the station include a main pumphouse and a smaller screening house, both built in 1897-98 as part of a major effort to modernize Providence's sewage treatment facilities.  A third structure, a boiler house, was demolished in 1987, and a tall smokestack was taken down in the 1930s.  The main pumphouse is a tall single-story brick structure with a hip roof and Colonial Revival features, and is set near Ernest Street, a short way east of its junction with Allens Avenue.  The screening house is a smaller square structure, also with a hip roof, set behind and to the right of the pumphouse.  The facility is used to pump raw sewage through an 88-inch main to the treatment facility.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

219,"Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a class of infantry employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scutum. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and one or two soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, not only as a strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.

History and deployment
Hastati appear to have been remnants of the old third class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The third class stood in the last few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to hastati, although they were more often than not relegated to providing missile support to the higher classes rather than fighting themselves. Penrose and Southern postulate that it is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used many smaller military units rather than a few larger ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.

Camillan system

By the 4th century BC the military the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans was still being used. Though its efficiency was doubtful, it proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome. The entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia in a crushing defeat that prompted reforms by Marcus Furius Camillus. Under the new system, men were sorted into classes based on wealth; the hastati were the third poorest, with the rorarii being slightly poorer and the principes slightly wealthier. Hastati were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8 metres (6 ft) long, from which the soldiers acquired their name. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and wearing bronze helmets, often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore light armour, the most common form being small breastplates, called ""heart protectors"".

In this type of legion, the 900 hastati formed 15 maniples, military units of 60 men each. Attached to each maniple were about 20 leves, javelin-armed light infantry. The hastati stood in the first battle line, in front of the principes of the second line and the triarii of the third. In a pitched battle, the leves would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with their javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii spearmen, who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routed enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least dependable troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.

Polybian system
By the time of the Punic wars of the 3rd century BC, the Camillan organisational system had been found to be inefficient. Under a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, with the hastati being the youngest and least experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to that which existed under the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each hastatus also carried two pila, heavy javelins that, according to Goldsworthy ""contrary to deeply entrenched myth"" did not bend on impact to make any struck shield useless or prevent the weapon from being thrown back. The weight and barb alone sufficiently hampered any struck shield (often penetrating the shield to hit the man behind it), and the iron was sufficiently hard that pila were often used as hand-held spears against both infantry and cavalry. By the time the volley of pila had reached the enemy line (usually only fifteen yards distant for best effect), the legionaries were charging and very quickly at work with their swords. There was rarely any time for the foe to find a pilum, pull it out of whatever it had hit and throw it back.

The hastati had been increased in number to 1,200 per legion, and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each. The rorarii and accensi had been disbanded. Leves had been replaced with velites, who had a similar role but were now also attached to principes and triarii. Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion; the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who had also been re-armed with swords. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.

This order of battle was almost always followed, the battle of the Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force, routing the opposing Carthaginian troops.

At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side by side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.

Marian reforms

With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against Jugurtha, king of Numidia in North Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Instead, it was decreed that soldiers would join the legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.

220,"A chafery is a variety of hearth used in ironmaking for reheating a bloom of iron, in the course of its being drawn out into a bar of wrought iron.  

The equivalent term for a bloomery was string hearth, except in 17th century Cumbria, where the terminology was that of the finery forge.  

A finery forge for the Walloon process would typically have one chafery to work two fineries (but sometimes one or three fineries).  

Chaferies were also used in the potting and stamping forges of the industrial revolution.

221,"Native American Pidgin English (AIPE) was an English-based pidgin spoken by Europeans and Native Americans in western North America. The main geographic regions AIPE was spoken in was British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington.

AIPE is mentioned in World Englishes as one of many factors influencing American English.

Native American Pidgin English is much more similar to English than many other English-based pidgins, and could be considered a mere ethnolect of American English.

The earliest variety of Pidgin English to appear in British North America is AIPE. AIPE was used by both Europeans and the Native Americans in the contact situation and is therefore considered to be a true pidgin. A pidgin language is made up of two languages sometimes spoken by only one group, but because AIPE was spoken by both groups some would say this makes it a true pidgin. The European people are the ones who taught the Native Americans how to speak English so they could develop AIPE together. This helped them communicate more efficiently.

Native American Pidgin English’s phonology is characterized primarily by decreasing the English phonemic record, through definite exchanges and the loss of some phonemes, together with other distributed phenomena.

226,"The William Grubb Farm, also known as Conway and Brook Manor, is located near Charles Town, West Virginia.  Built c. 1763 by William Grubb Jr., the house is a ""stone-ender,"" with stone masonry at the gable ends of the house and log construction on the long sides, now covered with clapboards.  The complex includes the house, a well course (1920), a corn crib (c. 1850), a barn (c. 1850), and a Quaker burial ground (c. 1759 and onwards).

History
In October 1734, Emanuel Grubb and John Grubb, Jr., the two oldest sons of John Grubb of Brandywine Hundred, Delaware, had  surveyed along the Bullskin Creek near Charles Town.  While it is unlikely that either Emanuel or John, Jr. ever traveled to the area, the next year, Emanuel's son John and John Grubb, Jr.'s son, William posted a 100-pound bond to secure the title, listed as Tract 76, Map 3.  William returned to Delaware, and Emanuel's sons John, James, Frances, Benjamin and Emanuel Jr. settled in the area where they shipped hides back to the family's tannery in Delaware.  In 1742, the family purchased two additional tracts, yielding  and nine years later purchased a further .

At the time, this was a tough frontier region and Benjamin Grubb became one of its colorful figures.  He and his associate David Morgan were once hauled before the magistrate after they took on all comers in a bar room brawl.  However, by 1864 Benjamin was the last member of Emanuel Grubb's family in the area when he sold the remainder of Emanuel's interest and relocated to North Carolina.

When John Grubb, Jr. died in 1758, his interest in the Bullskin Creek property was inherited by his son Adam, a Pennsylvania shipwright who had no use for the tract.  He leased the property to his older brother William Grubb (1713–1775), a Delaware farmer who had traveled to the Bullskin area in the mid-1730s to represent his father when the land was first acquired.  William was a leader in the Chichester, Pennsylvania Quaker Meeting and the church was interested in establishing a settlement in the Charles Town area.  On September 1, 1762, William and his brother, Samuel (another Delaware Quaker farmer) received an additional  from Lord Fairfax.

With the war now over, it became reasonably safe to settle in the region, and William's son, William Grubb, Jr. (1740 - c. 1810) relocated to the area from Delaware with his new bride, Susanna (probably Kerlin).  William and Susannah ultimately inherited all of the family's Bullskin lands where they raised eight children.  During the Revolution, William supplied over 100 barrels of whisky per month to his neighbor, George Washington.  By 1800 a mill had been built, which operated until 1935.  The Bullskin Run Quaker Meeting House was also on the property, but does not survive.  When William, Jr. died, the property was inherited by William Grubb III (c. 1779 - c. 1858) who moved to Ohio in 1814 and sold the property to his sister Rebecca and her husband, John Haines.  The house was expanded in 1880 by Warren Eby.

228,"Trinidad and Tobago sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Its participation in the Beijing games marked its eighteenth Olympic appearance and fifteenth Summer Olympic appearance since its debut at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, excluding its joint participation with Jamaica and Barbados in 1960 as the West Indies Federation. With 28 athletes, more Trinidadians had competed at the Olympics than in any other single Olympic games in its history before Beijing. Athletes representing Trinidad and Tobago advanced past the preliminary or qualification rounds in twelve events and reached the final rounds in four of those events. Of those four events, silver medals were won in the men's 100 meters (by Richard Thompson) and in the men's 4x100 meters relay (by Keston Bledman, Marc Burns, Emmanuel Callender, Richard Thompson, and Aaron Armstrong, who participated in the first round only). The latter was upgraded to gold due to one member of the quartet that crossed the line first, Nesta Carter, testing positive for a banned substance, resulting in their disqualification. The nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony that year was swimmer and Athens medalist George Bovell.

Background
Trinidad and Tobago is a two-island nation in the Caribbean Sea that lies close to South America. The nation has participated in the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and has appeared at every Summer Olympics since then with the exception of the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, when it joined Jamaica and Barbados in a political union called the West Indies Federation. Overall, Trinidad and Tobago had participated in eighteen Olympic games (15 Summer Olympics and 3 Winter Olympics) between its 1948 debut and its appearance at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and its fifteenth Olympic game since its independence, which was in 1962. The Trinidadian delegation in Beijing comprised its largest delegation by far, with 28 athletes. The previous record included 19 athletes, which happened in 1968, 1972, 2000 and 2004. Between 1948 and 2008, Trinidad and Tobago accumulated 14 medals (one gold, five silver and eight bronze); two of those medals were won in Beijing (a silver in the men's 100 meters another in the men's 4x100 meters relay). Richard Thompson, a male track athlete, medaled in the men's 100 meters but also medaled as a member of the Trinidadian relay team. All Olympians participating in Beijing for Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception of Dexter St. Louis in table tennis, were planning as of the end of the Beijing Olympics to continue training for future Olympic games.

Trinidad and Tobago's flagbearer at the opening ceremony was swimmer George Bovell, who won a bronze medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics as part of the Trinidadian delegation.

Trinidad and Tobago's athletes arrived in Beijing's Olympic Village early in August. The athletic contingent of Trinidad and Tobago's team arrived in Beijing from Finland on August 5, 2008, but spent only one night before leaving for a training camp in nearby South Korea. The athletics team returned on August 11. Sharpshooter Roger Daniel, along with the entirety of Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee's administrative and medical staff, had arrived in the Olympic Village by August 3, 2008.

Men's competition

Men's 100 meters

Then 23-year-old Darrel Brown, a sprinter from Arima on the island of Trinidad, participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf at the Beijing Olympics. His participation in Beijing marked his second Olympic appearance; he previously participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens as part of the men's 100 meters race. During the August 14 qualification round, Brown was placed in the fourth heat, finishing the event in 10.22 seconds and tying second-place finalist Pierre Browne of Canada. Browne and Brown finished behind Jamaica's Michael Frater (10.15 seconds), but ahead of Japan's Nobuharu Asahara (10.25 seconds). Out of the 80 athletes participating in the qualification round, Brown tied in seventh place with Browne and the United States' Tyson Gay. Brown progressed to the quarterfinal round.

Quarterfinals took place on August 15, and Brown was placed in the first heat. He finished the race in 10.93 seconds, finishing eighth of eighth athletes. He directly finished behind Poland's Dariusz Kuc (10.46 seconds). The leaders of the heat were Dutch Antilean Churandy Martina (9.99 seconds) and Jamaica's Frater (10.09 seconds). He finished last out of the 40 advancing athletes, and did not advance to semifinals.

Then 25-year-old Marc Burns, an Auburn University graduate from Port-of-Spain on Trinidad, represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 100 meters at Beijing. His participation marked his third Olympic games (2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens) and his second time running the event for Trinidad and Tobago. Burns raced during the August 14 qualification round in the ninth heat, where he completed his race in 10.46 seconds. Burns came in second and tied Slovenia's Matic Osovnikar, falling behind Qatari sprinter Samuel Adelebari Francis (10.40 seconds). Burns and Osovnikar finished ahead of Honduran athlete Cruz Rolando Palacios Castillo (10.49 seconds). Tying Osovnikar and Germany's Tobias Benjamin Unger for 38th place out of 80 athletes, Burns advanced to quarterfinals.

Burns was placed in the third heat during August 15 quarterfinals. He finished it in 10.05 seconds, taking first in the heat ahead of Kittitian athlete Kim Collins (10.07 seconds) and British athlete Tyrone Edgar (10.10 seconds). Francis, the leader of his qualification heat, took fourth place (10.11 seconds). Out of the forty quarterfinalists, Burns took sixth place. He advanced to semifinals.

Semifinals took place on August 16, and Burns was placed in the first heat. He ran his fastest time of the event during this race, completing the 100 meters in 9.97 seconds. Burns placed third behind the heat's leaders, Jamaica's Usain Bolt (9.85 seconds) and the United States' Walter Dix (9.95 seconds). Out of the sixteen semifinalists, Burns again placed sixth. He advanced to the final round, which took place later that day. Marc Burns finished the final round in 10.01 seconds and took seventh place, defeating the American Doc Patton (10.03 seconds) but falling behind Jamaica's Frater (9.97 seconds).

Then 24-year-old Trinidad-born sprinter and former Louisiana State University athlete Richard ""Torpedo"" Thompson also participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf at the Beijing Olympics' 100 meters race, marking his first appearance at any Olympic games. On the August 14 qualification round, Thompson raced in the third heat and completed his race in 10.24 seconds. He placed first in his heat of eight athletes, defeating French runner Martial Mbandjock (10.26 seconds) and Italian athlete Simone Collio (10.32 seconds). Thompson tied Antigua and Barbuda's Daniel Bailey for 10th place out of 80 athletes, and advanced to quarterfinals.

The August 15 quarterfinals saw Thompson in the second heat, where he again took first place when he finished the race in 9.99 seconds. Thompson defeated the United States' Tyson Gay (10.09 seconds) and France's Mbandjock (10.16 seconds). This time, out of the forty quarterfinalists, Thompson tied the Netherlands Antilles' Martina for second place behind only Usain Bolt. Thompson advanced to semifinals.

Thompson competed in the second heat during the August 16 semifinal round. He finished the race in 9.93 seconds, placing second out of eight athletes. Jamaica's Asafa Powell took first (9.91 seconds), and Churandy Martina took third (9.94 seconds). Thompson placed third out of the sixteen semifinalists, moving forward to the final round. Richard Thompson completed the final race in 9.89 seconds and medaled silver. In the event, Bolt medaled gold with a world and Olympic record-breaking 9.69 seconds, and Walter Dix medaled bronze with a time of 9.91 seconds.

Men's 200 meters

Then 30-year-old Houston-born Olympian Aaron Armstrong, son of American Olympian Debra Armstrong (née Edwards) and Trinidadian Olympian Ainsley Armstrong, participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf at the men's 200 meters event. The qualification round of the event took place on August 17, and Armstrong was placed in the eighth heat. He finished the race in 20.57 seconds, ranking first out of the finishing seven athletes in his heat. Armstrong bested Antigua and Barbuda's Brendan Christian (20.58 seconds), who finished second, and Canada's Jared Connaughton, who finished third. Out of the 66 competing athletes, Armstrong ranked eighth. He advanced to quarterfinals.

Quarterfinals took place on August 18, and Armstrong competed in the third heat, tying fourth-place finalist Marcin Jedrusinski with a time of 20.58 seconds. Armstrong and Jedrusinski fell behind Belgium's Kristof Beyens (20.50 seconds) but placed ahead of Nigeria's Obinna Metu (20.65 seconds). The leaders of the heat were Antigua and Barbuda's Christian (20.26 seconds) and the Netherlands Antilles' Churandy Martina (20.42 seconds). Overall, Armstrong placed 19th out of 32 qualifying quarterfinalists. He did not progress further.

Then 22-year-old Siparia, Trinidad-born runner Rondel Sorrillo participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf in the men's 200 meters dash, marking his first participation in any Olympic games. Sorillo participated in the fifth heat of the August 17 qualification round, placing first in his heat with a time of 20.58 seconds. Sorillo defeated Usain Bolt (20.64 seconds) and Kristof Beyens (20.69 seconds), the second and third-place finalists in his heat.

231,"Richard Owen Healey (7 December 192310 December 2000) was a New South Wales politician, ABC sports broadcaster, and minister of the crown in the cabinets of Sir Robert Askin, Tom Lewis and Sir Eric Willis. From 1973 to 1975 he was Minister for Youth and Community Services, when he was made Minister for Health, which he held until the Coalition lost office in May 1976. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for 19 years from 3 March 1962 until his retirement on 28 August 1981 for the Liberal Party.

Early life
Healey was born on 7 December 1923 in Broken Hill, New South Wales, the son of Allan Richard Healey and his wife Lurline McCloskey, and was educated at Parramatta High School. On 20 June 1942, at age 18, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a Warrant officer in Canada and saw service in England and the Middle East with No. 458 Squadron RAAF during World War II. He married Winifred Mary on 2 October 1945 in Brighton, England, having a daughter and two sons. On his return to Australia, he was demobilised on 17 January 1946 and worked first as a radio announcer and then as a sports editor at Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio from 1951 to 1962. He was appointed as Sports editor on ABC TV in 1956 until he entered parliament in 1962.

Political career
Healey was encouraged to enter into State politics by the then Liberal Leader Robert Askin and he was preselected to contest the seat of Wakehurst, a new seat with a notional Liberal majority, at the 1962 election. He was duly elected with 51.7% of the vote and went on to hold it a further two times in 1965 and 1968. After divorcing his first wife, Healey married Doreen Robins on 8 August 1963. He soon became a member of the Coalition Government, Liberal Party under Sir Robert Askin and the Country Party under Sir Charles Cutler, which swept into Government in 1965 after almost 25 years of Labor government.

He attended the official opening of The Forest High School as Member for Wakehurst on 24 October 1964, and later the official opening of Davidson High School as Member for Davidson in 1974.

On 3 December 1973, Healey was appointed a Minister of the Crown as Minister for Youth and Community Services until 3 January 1975. In 1975 he took over one of the most difficult portfolios, Minister for Health, a position he held until the defeat of the Sir Eric Willis Government in 1976. He stayed on in Opposition and served as Shadow Minister for Health from 28 May 1976 to 7 October 1978 under Willis and Peter Coleman and then as Shadow Minister for Police and Services under leader John Mason. He held his seat of Davidson for a further three times in 1973, 1976 and 1978 until he retired after losing a pre-selection contest to Terry Metherell on 28 August 1981.

232,"Rishra (works number 2007) was built in 1921 by Baguley Cars Ltd.  Following a working life in India it is now preserved at the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway, Buckinghamshire, England.

It is the one of only 31 Baguley steam locomotives built.

History
Baguley Cars Ltd took the order on 7 July 1919 for their works number 2007   locomotive and delivered in on 28 November 1921 to Light Railways Ltd.  

The locomotive was used by the Calcutta Corporation for shunting coal wagons at a water pumping station in Barrackpore, India.

Left abandoned in undergrowth, it was rescued in 1963 by Michael Satow, a senior executive of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), who had the locomotive restored at the Hooghly Docking and Engineering Company, Rishra, Kolkata (Calcutta).

It was repatriated to the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway in England by Satow in 1971. 

She is one of only four preserved locomotives fitted with Baguley valve gear, similar to the Bagnall-Price gear which was adopted by Bagnall after Ernest E. Baguley left that firm.

235,"Johann Goldfuss (December 11, 1908 Wildstein Austria-Hungary  (now Skalná, Czech Republic) – July 3, 1970 Schwandorf, Bavaria, Germany)  was a German luthier.
Born in Bohemia, he studied his craft with Mathias Heinicke, who was one of the main representatives of the school of luthiers of Saxony-Bohemia.  Johann Goldfuss worked with Heinicke for 17 years, becoming himself a master craftsman. His work was interrupted during World War II, when he was drafted and then taken prisoner of war.

When he was released, in 1949, he found out that his family had been expelled from Czechoslovakia and had moved to Schwandorf, Bavaria. He started his craft again, first repairing violins and eventually opened a new workshop for violins. His wife Katharina was able to go back to Czechoslovakia and to smuggle to his new homeland the tools which had been left behind. He built over 300 violins, violas and cellos which were known for the outstanding uniformity of their sounds.

He founded the ""Geigenbau Goldfuss"" company which specializes in the production of violins and string instruments which have gained recognition for their high quality and are used by violinists in concerts all over the world. Besides the production of string instruments, Johann Goldfuss is also known for his restoration of classical violins. He died of a heart attack on July 3, 1970.

The company founded by Johann Goldfuss was taken over by his son Horst Goldfuss (*1941) and has 1985 moved to Regensburg.

The company later was taken over by Thomas Goldfuss (*1966)

239,"A jar was an early unit of capacitance once used by the British Royal Navy. The term originated as the capacitance of a Leyden jar.  Its value is such that one farad is  jars and one jar is 1111 picofarads.

History 
With early spark-gap transmitters, changing the transmission frequency was most easily accomplished by changing the number of Leyden jars connected to the tank circuit. While it was possible to calculate the required capacitance directly, it was more usual to simply have a book of lookup tables which gave the number of jars needed for any likely wavelength.

Nugent was the eldest son and heir of Thomas Nugent, 6th Earl of Westmeath and adopted the courtesy title of Lord Delvin in 1754 when his father acceded to the earldom.

In 1759, he was elected Member of Parliament for Fore, although he was underage. He was also commissioned a cornet in the 1st Regiment of Dragoons.

In July 1761, the drunken Lord Delvin accosted a female acquaintance of Capt. George Reilly, and was challenged to a duel. The two crossed swords in the music room at Marlborough Bowling Green, and Delvin was mortally wounded. The incident led to the abandonment of Marlborough Green as a fashionable resort.

250,"The Bernard Corrigan House is a historic residence at 1200 West 55th Street in the Country Club District, Kansas City, Missouri. The building is an important regional example of the Prairie Style, and it was one of the earliest residential structures in Kansas City to make extensive use of reinforced concrete. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

History
Bernard Corrigan was born in Quebec in 1847, and he moved to Kansas City in 1858. Corrigan built his fortune as a contractor, street railway magnate, and real estate speculator. He hired architect Louis S. Curtiss to design his grand estate at the corner of 55th Street and Ward Parkway. Corrigan's own firm served as the contractor for the project, and construction began on the home in 1912. The house was completed the following year, but Corrigan died suddenly in January 1913, only two months before he was scheduled to move into his new house. Corrigan's widow sold the property to Patrick J. White in 1914 for $101,370.86.  White owned the property until 1917, when he sold it to Joseph J. Heim.

Joseph J. Heim was originally from St. Louis, Missouri, where he learned the techniques of brewing. Heim came to Kansas City in 1884 where he began building his brewery empire. By 1901, the Heim Brewery in the East Bottoms had become the largest brewery in Kansas City, producing in excess of 140,000 barrels annually. Heim and his brothers also opened an amusement park near the brewery in 1899. The amusement park featured Heim beer piped in directly from the nearby brewery. Heim was also involved with numerous other business ventures including real estate, banking, street railways, and telephone companies.  Heim lived in the Corrigan for only six and a half years.  He sold the house when his wife died.

Robert Sutherland acquired the home from Heim in 1923 for $90,000. Sutherland was a native of the state of Kansas, who moved to Kansas City at age sixteen and began working in a lumber yard. Sutherland began to acquire numerous lumber yards in the early 1900s, which brought him considerable fortune. Sutherland died in 1941, but his widow continued to own and reside in the Corrigan House.

Architecture

Exterior

While the house incorporates elements from several architectural styles, the most obvious elements are in the Prairie School architecture, particularly in the emphasis on horizontal lines in the composition.  The house is a three-story structure built over a full basement, and it is about  long from north to south. The foundation is reinforced concrete, and the exterior walls are faced with gray shot-sawn limestone from Carthage, Missouri. The actual maker of the art glass used in numerous windows and doors is unknown, but the glass itself was most likely supplied by the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works of Kokomo, Indiana.

Interior

The full basement contains laundry, heating, and cooling facilities.

The first floor entrance hall features two expanses of stained glass. The ceiling of the hall is two stories, with oak beams lining the ceiling.  The main staircase is located in the main entrance hall.  The east wing of the first floor contains the living room with large marble fireplace and the conservatory. The west wing contains the kitchen, dining room, butler's pantry, parlor, and a secondary staircase.

The second floor contains at least five bedrooms and two bathrooms.

The third floor originally contained a game room, additional servants quarters, and storage space.

251,"The Swan River is in Suffolk County on Long Island, New York. It flows into Swan Lake from the north, and then south out of the lake into the mouth of Patchogue Bay, which then becomes the Great South Bay. Originally, the headwaters reached as far north as Medford, New York, near the vicinity of the Long Island Rail Road's Medford station. Swan River is a relatively clean, cold, free flowing, freshwater stream, generally less than 15 feet wide, with a sandy substrate. This segment of the river flows through much undeveloped forested wetland, but has also been encroached upon by residential development, road construction, and a commercial sand mining operation. Below Montauk Highway, the river is tidal, and is bordered by undeveloped marshland and limited development of boat docking facilities. The fish and wildlife habitat encompasses the entire river, including an approximate one and one-half mile tidal segment, and an approximate two and one-half mile freshwater segment, which extends from Swan Lake, above Montauk Highway, to the headwaters of the stream, above Swan Lake, flowing southward into Patchogue Bay.

Swan River is one of only a few free-flowing, spring-fed streams on Long Island that have remained in a relatively natural state. Above Swan Lake, this creek provides habitat conditions suitable for natural reproduction by brook trout, and supports one of approximately 6 known wild populations of this species on Long Island. In addition to native fish populations in Swan River, concentrations of sea-run brown trout occur in the tidal segment below Montauk Highway, during their fall spawning period (September–November). The concentrations of salmonids in Swan River support a recreational fishery of county-level significance. However, no formal public access to the area has been developed. No unusual concentrations of any wildlife species are known to occur in the area.
A few local marinas and untouched wild life are spread throughout its almost 2 mile run There are residential homes spread  throughout the river's edge.

History 

From the 17th century onward, Patchogue was a major maritime center on the south shore. Settled initially by Native Americans, this center was favored by English colonists who traveled from New England to Long Island in the late 17th century, working the bay to harvest shellfish and finfish.

Notable bay families included the Duffys, Flints, Weeks and other families, who purchased property near the creeks in order to dock their boats.

They built shacks that were used as shucking houses, one of which remains on Avery Avenue. Their homes still remain as reminders of this rich tradition, primarily in East Patchogue along Swan River Creek on Conklin Avenue.

In the 21st century, not as many baymen still work the waters of Swan River, Patchogue and the Great South Bay.

252,"Henry W. Hoagland (1912–1995) was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and attended Stanford University and Harvard Business School. During World War II he served with the Military Planning Division of the Quartermaster Corps. In 1946 he obtained a job with the Field Service Staff of the Republican National Committee, in which he campaigned for Republican congressmen in marginal districts. During 1947 and 1948 he was Deputy Director of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. In August 1948 he resigned from the Committee to campaign for Republican congressional candidates. After the 1948 election Hoagland obtained a job with the American Research and Development Corporation of Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked for over twenty years. However, he continued to be active in Republican politics, and took frequent leaves of absence from his job to help with Republican campaign work.

Down to 1954 Hoagland continued to assist Republican candidates in marginal districts, particularly in Indiana, Ohio and Colorado. In 1954 he began to work as an advance man for President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s campaign trips. In this capacity he went to cities that the President was planning to visit and make all the local arrangements. He helped arrange for coverage of the visit by local news media. He helped plan the route of the President's motorcade and convinced local businesses to allow their employees to leave work at the time of the motorcade so large crowds could be assembled as the President passed. Hoagland also met with local Republican leaders to determine who would travel with the President or sit with him at local events, a matter of great importance to politicians who hoped to gain recognition by being seen with the President. Hoagland kept extensive notebooks regarding his work as an advance man, and also collected schedules and local newspaper articles about the President's trips. The last trip he planned for Eisenhower was a proposed visit to Liberal, Kansas, in October 1964, after Eisenhower had left the White House. The trip was cancelled at the last minute due to the death of former president Herbert Hoover.

254,"The 2009 cash for influence scandal (also cash for amendments or cash for laws) was a political scandal in the United Kingdom in 2009 concerning four Labour Party Life Peers offering to help make amendments to legislation for up to £120,000. The Lords Privileges Committee recommended the two men be suspended from the House for up to six months after an investigation into allegations made against four Labour peers. Lord Taylor of Blackburn was suspended as a Labour Party member pending the investigation while Lord Truscott quit the party. On 20 May, the House of Lords considered the report of the Privileges Committee and voted to suspend Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott for six months.

The suspensions were the first since Oliver Cromwell’s era in the 1640s. The previous member to be suspended from the House of Lords is believed to have been Thomas Savile, who was barred in 1642 for siding with King Charles I.

Allegations

The allegations were made by The Sunday Times Insight team in an article published on Sunday, 25 January 2009.  In a series of covert interviews, the four peers stated that they could use their political influence to amend legislation. The individuals concerned were Lord Snape, Lord Moonie, Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott. Six other peers either declined to help or did not respond to the undercover reporters' approach.

The newspaper claimed its reporters approached the four peers masquerading as lobbyists acting for an unnamed company. The firm, they said, wanted to set up a chain of shops in the UK and were seeking exemption from current laws on business rates.

A recording was later released of Lord Taylor saying firms paid him up to £100,000 a year. Lord Taylor tells an undercover reporter: ""Some companies that I work with would pay me £100,000 a year."" When the reporter questions it, he adds: ""That's cheap for what I do for them. And other companies would pay me £25,000.""

On 30 January, The Sunday Times released further material via their website containing audio and video purporting to show Lord Truscott describing how the passage of legislation in both the House of Commons and House of Lords could be influenced and what part he could play in successfully facilitating amendments on behalf of paying clients.

Two of the fundamental principles set out in the Code of Conduct for the House of Lords are that members ""must never accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence"" and ""must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask any question in the House or a committee, or promote any matter, in return for payment or any other material benefit (the ""no paid advocacy"" rule).""

Reaction

Following publication of The Sunday Times article, the Labour Party immediately promised an urgent investigation. The Leader in the House of Lords, Lady Royall said she had spoken to the four Labour peers concerned and would be ""pursuing the matter with utmost vigour"". She also said House of Lords members must ""abide by its high standards.""

In a statement to the House of Lords on 26 January Lady Royall called the claims ""deeply shocking"". She pointed out that they were only allegations at this stage but said the claims had been ""damaging not just to this House but to Parliament and politics"". She said the matter had been referred to the Lords Interests sub committee (a sub committee of the Committee for Privileges), which had already met and investigations were underway. She said she believed ""tougher sanctions"" were needed to deal with peers who broke the rules and she had written to the chairman of the Committee on Standards and Privileges to ask him to review the matter.

On 26 January, two of the four peers made statements in The House of Lords. Lord Snape told The House ""As one of the people involved in this incident may I first of all apologise for bringing this House, if I have done so, into disrepute. But may I say that these are allegations in a Sunday newspaper and may I appeal to noble lords in all parts of the House to allow me the opportunity to refute these allegations before your lordships house and elsewhere.""

Lord Taylor stated ""If I have done anything that has brought this House into disrepute I most humbly apologise. I feel within my own conscience I followed the rules and the directions that have been given in this House over the 31 years I have been a member.""

Lord Truscott told the BBC he did admit to having had ""discussions"" with a reporter, but said that ""to suggest I would offer to put down amendments for money is a lie.""

Lord Moonie acknowledged discussing a fee of £30,000 but said he had not done anything ""outside the rules"".

The Conservative Party leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, said the allegations represented a ""shocking and depressing moment"" for the House of Lords. ""This House has been mired in a grim torrent of criticism about a culture of sleaze,"" he told peers. ""If these allegations are true those involved have shamed this House,"" he said, adding there were no ""grey areas in the paid advocacy rules"".

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: ""It's important that we don't pre-judge these investigations but these are serious allegations and we are determined to get to the bottom of these allegations, and whatever action needs to be taken will be taken.""

The Liberal Democrats wrote to Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asking for an investigation to take place.

SNP MP Angus MacNeil, whose complaint started the ""cash for honours"" called for the four peers to be suspended, while an investigation is carried out.

Findings of House of Lords Committees
The House of Lords Sub-committee on Lords' Interests was asked to report on the matter. It found that Lord Moonie had not expressed a willingness to breach the code, but that Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had all done so. Truscott and Taylor were additionally found to have failed to act on their personal honour.

The Lords' Privileges Committee considered the sub-committee's report and heard further evidence from Lord Snape. It published its findings on 14 May 2009. It found that Lord Moonie and Lord Snape had not breached the code, but that Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had done, and recommended that they be suspended.

Police investigations

On 29 January 2009 it was confirmed that Police were looking at the allegations following the complaint by the Liberal Democrats.
On 11 February 2009 the Metropolitan Police confirmed that no action would be taken, noting that ""The application of the criminal law to members of the House of Lords in the circumstances that have arisen here is far from clear,"" and that ""In addition, there are very clear difficulties in gathering and adducing evidence in these circumstances in the context of parliamentary privilege.""

255,"The  is a special forces unit established by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force on March 27, 2001 in response to a spy ship incursion that had taken place on the Noto Peninsula in 1999. The unit was created to perform similar roles to those undertaken by American Navy SEALs and the British SBS. Its structure is based on that of the SBS. It is based in Etajima, Hiroshima.

The unit's roles involve maritime anti-terrorist duties, including operations where arms are known to be involved. However, its duties and responsibilities overlap with those of the Special Security Team, the Japan Coast Guard's counter-terrorist unit. However, the SST has the right to detain anyone lawfully.

Information on SBU personnel, training and weapons is classified and not available. Its operators wear balaclavas to protect their identities when operating where they can be seen. Due to the nature of their duties and responsibilities, an amendment had been passed to raise their salaries.

History
After a failed Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces mission to stop North Korean spy ships that were in Japanese territorial waters off the Noto Peninsula, the SBU was established with its headquarters in Etajima, Hiroshima. The unit had conducted some covert training in Etajima after its creation, including exercises on boarding tactics to enter ships. Training was completed in 2000, a year after the SBU was created.  A ship reported to have illegally entered Amami Ōshima was seen nearby, which led to the mobilization of the SBU. The ship, however, was said to have been scuttled before they could intervene. The unit made its existence known to the public in 2007 during a training exercise, which involved the deployment of Howa Type 89–armed SBU operators via RHIBs and SH-60J helicopters.

When the unit was created, it had requested training with the US Navy SEALs, but had not been able to do so due lack of available personnel who could train the candidates. To resolve this, the SBU had requested training assistance from the SBS to help in founding the unit. A SBS instructor was sent to Japan from February to March 2000.

In 2006, Iku Aso of the Shūkan Bunshun reported that the SBU was discreetly deployed to Iraq to work with American special forces in a mission to save Japanese nationals taken hostage under ""Operation Babylon's Sakura"", but they were never given the orders to intervene.

It was announced on January 2009 by Yasukazu Hamada that the SBU would possibly be deployed for its first mission to Somalia to engage in anti-piracy operations. The SBU was involved in anti-pirate exercises with the Samidare and the Sazanami at Bungo Channel between Shikoku and Kyushu on February 11, 2019. SBU operators had left Japan on March 14, 2009 deployed on board the Murasame-class destroyer JDS DD-106 Samidare and the Takanami-class destroyer JDS DD-113 Sazanami. The SBU would be deployed in operations with SH-60K helicopters. The deployment was made under Article 82 of the SDF Law.

Prior to the SBU's overseas deployment to Somalia, the unit had practiced alongside Japan Coast Guard units in simulating a raid on a pirate vessel played by JCG officers without any warning shots fired by SBU operators off the coast of Kure, Hiroshima with a total of 250 people participating, 60 from the JCG. In the Somalian deployment, SBU forces don't have the power to detain suspected pirates, so JCG officers would be responsible for making arrests.

In 2012, restrictions for female JMSDF personnel to join the SBU were lifted. As of 2021, no female sailor has passed SBU requirements to enlist.

The SBU was deployed in 2016 at the 42nd G7 summit, providing security alongside the Special Assault Team. In 2017, they were deployed under the Combined Maritime Forces mandate from the JS Teruzuki. During that time, the SBU responded to a boat that was drifting in the Gulf of Aden.

SBU operators participated with the Commandos Marine in maritime exercises in August 2019. The unit participated in the Malabar 2021 military exercises with United States Naval Special Warfare Command and MARCOS commandos.

Controversy
Controversy had developed from the SBU when a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces cadet had died during a supposed training exercise prior to admission to the unit when it was reported on October 2008. The incident consisted of 15 levels of unarmed combat training. The JMSDF has refused to provide more details on the incident, calling them classified material. However, a special committee was established to determine whether the cadet's death was either under murder or an accident. Investigators of the Criminal Investigation Command had assessed the incident.

Reports on the incident have classified the events as a case of bullying by senior JMSDF sailors against junior sailors. But the committee had suggested that the deceased cadet was killed accidentally after receiving a right hook punch by his 14th opponent during the exercise, specifically to the chin.

Four JMSDF sailors were charged for their involvement in the cadet's death.

A report filed by the Ministry of Defense recommended the implemenation of stringent safety standards, especially on concerns when highly strenous activities such as physical combat training is taking place.

Foreign relations
The SBU has been involved in matters involving Asia-Pacific defense, with representatives sent to the Asia Pacific Defense Forum Summer 2002 and the Asia Pacific Defense Forum 2004.

Formation
As of 2014, the SBU has six platoons with one main headquarters.

90 operators are known to be in the SBU.

Weapons and equipment
It is known that the SBU uses the HK MP5A5 as the primary submachine guns. Their service rifle is the Howa Type 89, and the Heckler & Koch HK416 while their sidearm is the SIG Sauer P226R. The SBU has been armed with the SIG-Sauer MPX with 9mm and training versions acquired.

Sniper rifles were purchased for the SBU under the 2004 defense budget under the JMSDF, but the type chosen has not been revealed to the public. Although it's known that they use the Heckler & Koch MSG-90.

The SBU has use of RHIBs for maritime operations while SH-60J helicopters are used for aerial insertions during shipboarding missions.

SBU opeators in Somalia were spotted wearing Ops-Core helmets.

Training
SBU candidates are schooled at the Naval Academy Etajima's 1st Service School. Basic education is done at the school while the rest is done in a training program prior to recruitment.

Name
Together with neighboring Mala Ligojna (literally 'Little Ligojna'), Velika Ligojna (literally, 'Big Ligojna') was attested in written sources in 1309 as Luckossel (and as Lucozel in 1317, Lvkozel in 1318, and Vunderludigoni in 1526). The medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was Luko(va) sela (literally, 'Luka's village') in the 14th century, probably originally based on the name *Ľudigojь and then confused in the transcriptions with the similar name Luka. If so, today's name is a result of the sound change ľu- > li- and modern vowel reduction, and means 'Ljudigoj's village'.

Church
The local church in Velika Ligojna is dedicated to Saint George and belongs to the Parish of Vrhnika. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1526 and was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century. It was surrounded by a defensive wall during the Ottoman wars in Europe.

263,"Up from Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence is a 2002 book on human evolution, the human brain, and the origins of human cognition by John Skoyles and Dorion Sagan. The book considers how the brain and genes evolved into their present condition over the course of thousands and millions of years. It was published by McGraw Hill.

The book argues that the earlier ape brain had evolved “mindmakers” and that the human mind arose when these were “rewired” by symbols. This new “mindware” was created by the prefrontal cortex in combination with neural plasticity. This “Symbolic capacity is the ‘missing link’ that changed the ape brain into a human and made mindware possible, allowing symbols to structure the brain”. p. 277 Mindware itself has been evolving for the last 120,000 years and as a result kept reshaping human consciousness, thought and culture. Its last chapter speculates upon the future of human cognition.

The title relates to Carl Sagan (co-author Dorion Sagan's father) and his 1977 book The Dragons of Eden for which this book provides a 25th-anniversary reappraisal.

Chapters 
 Cosmic Mirror: The questions of who and what humans are explored in terms of the history of the universe, life and humankind as when looking in a mirror.
Up from Dragons: Modern human genes arose when humans evolved as hunter-gatherers. But in the last 120,000 years humans have changed from hunter-gatherers to hi-tech citizens. The book seeks to answer why and how.
Neurons Unlimited: The brain is neurally plastic (NP) – evolution left open the function of human neurons. The capacity of its neurons to engage in imagination extends its potential to think and feel.
Superbrain:  The prefrontal cortex (PC) is the brain's ""conductor"". It directs using inner representations as prompts which organize the brain's ""orchestra"" of neural “talents”.
Mind-Engine: Cognition depends upon brain waves that bind through synchronization of diverse brain areas into mental unity. The prefrontal cortex controls this unification of the brain.
Neural Revolution: The large sized human brain has extensive ""blank"" cortex available for processing nonevolved skills. But acquiring such skills requires that the brain’s neural networks get “trained”—which the prefrontal cortex does by acting as a “cortical catalyst”.
Machiavellian Neurons: Humans like other apes live in social groups that split and reform. Humans are novel in their ability to decouple these social and personal bonds from direct sensory contact. The human brain does this by carrying around its social group as an ""inner troop within our heads"".
The Troop within Our Heads: Humans think they are free—but this troop within their heads rules human thoughts, feelings and actions. Due to it humans feel guilt, shame, pride and self-consciousness.
Our Living Concern: Underlying human experience are mindmakers. One such mindmaker is the anterior cingulate as it creates attention to what is done. It underlies not only social consciousness, but pain, and a sense of reality.
Doing the Right Thing: Our sense of right and wrong arises from our origins as social apes. Morality is a byproduct of the troop within our heads that is created by the orbitofrontal cortex mindmaker. This limits human freedom by preventing psychopathic-like actions.
Where Memories are Made: The human sense of identity arises from the need of the brain to experience a past linked to the present. Here, the mindmaker is the hippocampus. It underlies memory and the sense of continuity of self, other and place.
What Are We?: Mindmakers are not consciousness but they make it possible. They become the consciousness of ""I"" and ""will"" by embodiment. The human brain embodies not only its body extension, but its “troop within its head” and the inner orchestration done by its prefrontal cortex.
Of Human Bonding: The change that turned apes into humans was the ability to decouple social and personal bonds from everyday contact. This allowed new kinds of bonds such as those of marriage, in-law kin, culture and religion.
The Symbolic Brain: Symbols enabled this decoupling of bonds. Symbols are cognitive stand-ins—a wedding ring stands in for a marriage bond. The prefrontal cortex generates symbols. This enabled hunter-gatherer genes to develop new forms of social life including that of modern people.
Lucy and Kanzi: The symbol making potential of the prefrontal cortex arose to enable extended family bonds across the African savannah. “Gifted environments” also arose created by adults so young brains could be helped to learn and enrich their minds with symbols.
The Runaway Species: Homo brains expanded to be good parents. Successful brains selected partners with brains with which they could best raise children. A runaway selection resulted between brain size, mate selection and skilled parenting.
The Billion-Hour Journey: That modern people are not hunter-gatherers is due to mindware – the mind expanding systems of symbols – that evolved in the last 120,000 years.  The process started slow, but then “bootstrapped” itself and accelerated. It now underlies the thoughts and feelings of modern humans.
Third Millennium Brain: The rewriting of the brain's potentials that started in the past still continues. “Braintech” is arising and will enhance humans even more. It is suggested that humans knowing that their origins lie in their brains, rather than ancient myth, will gain Brain Rights and enter a new Era—that of the Brain.

Concepts
The book introduces and argues for novel ideas in human evolution, neuroscience, social neuroscience and the humanities.

Human evolution

Gifted environments
These are the learning environments humans create. Components of a gifted environment include “a rich variety of representations”, a “stimulating learning environment”, and “’empowering environments’—ones which foster specific paths of development, an opportunity sometimes limited to brief windows of developmental time” It is proposed that such gifted environments are created by adult prefrontal cortex. The potential to create gifted environments predates humans and exists in chimpanzees. But they are limited because as adults chimpanzees lack time, cooperate only weakly and are under constant stress. It was the highly cooperative sociability of humans that allowed gifted environments to arise that could fully support cognitive development.

Human change bootstrapping problem
Bootstrapping concerns the paradox that the best way for something to occur is for it to already to be established. This problem has been identified in computer and cognitive science as an important obstacle: computers need to load programs to start but this is best done when they have already loaded the program for doing this; reading is easier to acquire once a person can already read. Cognitive development can be interpreted as the process by which cognitive systems sidestep and work around bootstrapping problems that would otherwise obstruct cognitive growth. The bootstrapping problem is proposed to explain why human cultural and technological developments often take so long to historically develop and then accelerate: the best circumstances for such innovations to flourish often arise only when they already exist.

Human ticket
All animal species except humans live in much the same biological manner in which they evolved. Humans in contrast have journeyed away from being simple hunter-gatherers to becoming citizens of hi-tech nation states. Biologically this is odd since modern people still basically have the same genes as their early hunter-gatherers ancestors. This raises the question of what had evolved, the ticket, in those early humans that gave them to the potential to change later on so radically.

NP + PC Formula
The evolution of human intelligence is expressed in a Neural Plasticity + Prefrontal Cortex formula that is progressively elaborated:
NP + PC + ape mind = human mind
NP + PC + fission-fusion ape social skills = human social symbols
NP + PC + ape sensory and motor skills = human nonsocial symbols
NP + PC + FF ape skills + symbols + 109 hours = contemporary mind
NP + PC + mindware + braintech = future mind

Neuroscience

Cognitive stand-ins
Symbols adapt already evolved functions to create novel ones by replacing their evolved inputs and outputs with nonevolved representations. Reading and writing are such new functions that rewire the functions of  visual, speech and other cortical areas by letters and logogram stand-ins.

Cortical catalyst
Chemical catalysts work by creating chemical bonds by bringing existing substances into reaction using intermediaries, and by temporal and spatial conjunction. The prefrontal cortex works similarly upon information processing happening elsewhere in the brain through creating working memory space. This space allows novel intermediary forms of association to be created and held together between different information processing systems in the brain. This process is essential to the formation of symbols and symbol based cognition.

Free cortex
Due to brain enlargement in humans, most of the human cerebral cortex lacks tightly evolved functions and so is open to acquire nonevolved skills. Even highly evolved cortical areas such as the primary visual and auditory cortices can to a surprising degree take on new functions. Semantics can develop in the visual cortex of those born blind, and vision can develop in the auditory cortex in experimental animals when retinal input is redirected into it. The association areas of the cerebral cortex lack the input constraints of primary areas. As a result, they are even more open to acquire novel cognitive capabilities.

Memory headers
John Morton has proposed that memories are organized by headed records.  The function of the hippocampus is suggested to be providing such headers for memory. They also underlie the human capacity to experience in spite of superficial changes the continuity of self, other and place.

Pain as benevolent dictator
Pain is argued to be a protective attentive envelope (see below) that temporary acts to protect injured or easily injured parts of the body from actions controlled by the brain.

Protective attentive envelopes
Aircraft have flight envelope protection systems that stop pilots acting in a manner that might harm the aircraft but which allow them to make quick but safe actions. The anterior cingulate cortex is argued to act as a “hidden observer” over what we do “attention-to-action” and it provides a similar function for humans. These envelopes underlie the experience of self-consciousness, anxiety and pain.

Social neuroscience

Limbic symbolons
Symbolons were ancient Greek tokens or insignia by which people who were bonded could spot each other (the word comes from the Greek “symballein” which means “to throw together”). The problem of social  primates is to create bonds that are flexible yet also allow prolonged separation. Limbic symbolons are symbols that enable emotional attachments established in other apes by smell, grooming and to some degree sight, to cope with physical separation by an internal (mental name) or external (wedding ring) stand-in that is always cognitively present. Limbic symbols are usually publicly defined (another advantage) and acquired in rituals. “Early hominid environments were dangerous and food resources patchy and irregular, which placed a premium on individuals able to exploit kin relations and extend social links beyond the immediate present. Such pressures promoted symbolism, originally to stand for kin recognition and social relationships, enabling these to be maintained over time and space even when the relevant individuals were absent. These developments in turn lead to more complex social networks and the cognitive abilities to exploit these.”

Nonimmediate sociability
Two kinds of sociability exist: immediate and nonimmediate. The former depends upon sensory interaction with others such as smell, touch, sound or vision. Nonimmediate depends upon carrying the experience of the group within the head. Such sociability is already present in apes and is due to processes called mindmakers. But due to the modification of these mindmakers with symbolons, sociability in groups has become highly developed in humans. The combination of symbols and mindmakers created social mindware.

Mindmakers
These are “processes that weave this sense we all have of being a ‘me. .. give existence its animated feel, the feeling of being alive. They are clues to understanding such things as our freedom and the links between the prefrontal cortex’s inner cues and our hidden sociability’”.  Mindmakers evolved to enable animals to remain part of a social group when separated. Mindmaker processes are identified in the anterior cingulate cortex (protective attentive envelopes), hippocampus (continuity), orbitofrontal cortex (social right and wrong). Mindmakers are present in other animals but only in humans have they become extensively elaborated. They also provide the neural substrate for cultural symbolism and so the human ability to sustain socially defined groups and personal bonds.

Mindware
Mindware is the symbolic counterpart of mindmakers. The concept differs from that of memes in the way that the descriptive notion of a “bridge” differs from that of specified engineering types of bridges (suspension, cantilever, arch and so on). In the latter, what transmits is understood in terms of the specific engineering processes that support that transmission rather than the general idea of transmission. The use of a wedding ring is a meme when viewed from the perspective of transmitted culture, but it is mindware when viewed from the neurological changes it makes to the attachment processes in the brain that sustain the emotional bond of marriage.  The acquisition of social mindware is closely linked with rituals.   In mindware “the human ape found a brain programming language to bond across time and place—symbolic culture. This was to change forever what it meant to be a brain. Now the human mind could live in thousands of varieties of life. …with their mindware humans set themselves apart from other animals and the rest of nature”.

Social embodiment
The subjective sense of embodiment in our extended physical body relates to its capacity to act through it and so interact with the autonomous physical world. The human brain also acts within the autonomous world of social relationships. This social embodiment gives rise to a sense of social “me” . Consciousness is the embodied attention of the brain to its causality in such social relationships and the physical world.

Superfission-fusion ape
The sociability of social apes is fission-fusion. In this members of a group regularly separate into small subgroups (fission) but at the same time still belong to the same group (fusion). Human are unique in the robust ability of their bonds to survive prolonged physical separation. This is due to symbols. Another factor is that these bonds can be publicly defined and so create symbolic culture. This makes humans a superfission-fusion ape.

Humanities

Brain Age
The Era that will follow the present one will be the Brain Age. In this neuroscience will replace the ancient myths that at present shape how people understand themselves. Further, braintech (see below) will arise that enables humans to reshape the competences of their brain. This Era will continue the reshaping of our species that has happened since its origins 120,000 years ago. Braintech represents the last frontier faced by the human species.

Brain Rights
Humans are social primates who use superficial differences (such as skin pigmentation) or symbols based upon ancient myth to identify their group membership. Brains offer a firmer foundation for our identity since they underlie the core of who we are in our shared “vulnerability, richness, history, and giftedness”.  Understanding this is our true nature. It follows that “Each of our brains should be guaranteed the right to grow unhandicapped and supplied with the best possible nurture and support”, and “a gifted environment sensitive to its uniqueness”.

Braintech
Humans from early on when using stone tools have created technologies that have enhanced their abilities. This will continue with the still unexplored potential of the brain. One area is awareness of its hidden functioning as this is needed to better train it. The future of present functional imaging is proposed to be akin to that of computers as in the 1960s. Like such past computers such technology will spiral down in price and convenience so that this braintech (like computers today) will become an essential part of everyday human life.

Criticisms

 Fails to link with earlier work upon “cognitive ergonomics”.p. 143
 The description of the prefrontal cortex “begs for more commentary on their likely causes, consequences, and context”.p. 143
 Fails to discuss helping behavior before “primate or even mammalian sociality emerged”.p. 144
 Should have explored cost/benefits of sociosexual selection.p. 146
 Lacks “an unambiguous definition of mindware … the resemblance to (if not identity with) ‘culture’ needs to be explored”.p. 146
 The field of psychoneuroendocrinology and the developmental forces such as sensitive periods and behavior genetics is neglected.p. 147
 Its account of consciousness which depends upon coherence does not explain “possession, dissociation, out-of-body experiences and addictions”.p. 279
 “The authors seem to fall all too easily into a simplistic materialism”.p. 279
 The notion of Brain Age is wrong: “It is not the brain age, but the mind age, the culture age, the dawning realization of our capacity to program our brain to do many different things.p. 279
 Lacks anatomical and flowchart illustrations.
 Does not discuss the work of Leda Cosmides and John Tooby nor Steven Mithen.

""The Garden"" was sung by Take That on the back of a huge mechanical elephant carrying them from the B-stage to the main stage.
While singing ""What Is Love"", Take That members made themselves up as clowns on stage for the following Clown Medley which was a parody of their old boyband dance routines. During ""It Only Takes a Minute"" Donald, Orange and Owen rode unicycles (Orange said in the tour documentary it was Donald's idea) while Barlow rode a child's bike with stabilisers, making fun of his reputation as the clumsy member of the band. In ""Relight My Fire"" Take That played animal trainers with female dancers playing wild beasts.

271,"Burt Myers (born December 30, 1975) is a race car driver on NASCAR's Whelen Southern Modified Tour.  In 1999, at the age of 23, he became the youngest Bowman Gray Stadium track champion in history.  He has won more pole awards than any other driver in the Whelen Southern Modified Tour's history.
Myers has 19 career wins and won the 2010 and 2016 NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour Championship.

History

In 1952 Bobby Myers, Burt's great uncle, set the record for the youngest driver ever to win a Stadium title at the age of 25. Bobby won 16 Races and 1 championship in 1952. Five years later, in 1957, Bobby was killed in a crash at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina while driving for Lee Petty. Billy Myers was Burt Myers grandpa and he ranks 20th with 22 victories on Bowman Gray Stadium's Modified All-Time Wins List, and he has won 3 championships ('51,'53,'55). Billy died at Bowman Gray Stadium. In 1999, at the age of 23, Burt Myers broke his great uncle's record.

Burt's father, Gary Myers, is the second generation of Myers' to compete at Bowman Gray Stadium.  Gary ranks seventh on the stadium's all-time victory list with a total of thirty-eight (38) wins.  In addition, he was the 1996 champion on the NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour.

In 2009 Myers made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut at Martinsville Speedway in the Kroger 200. He drove the No. 07 JRC Investments / Wyatt Winstead Foundation Chevrolet owned by Ken Smith. He would start 17th and finish 19th, one lap down.

Myers was put on probation by NASCAR for the 2009 racing season at Bowman Gray Stadium, along with fellow competitor Junior Miller, as result of his actions in 2008 final race.

He was featured in Madhouse, a History Channel television documentary series that followed the drivers at Bowman Gray Stadium for a racing season, as well as the Discovery Channel series Race Night at Bowman Gray.
He is also a ten-time champion at Bowman Gray Stadium.

277,"Bangkok Haunts is a novel by John Burdett, first published in 2007.

Plot
Detective Sonchai, of the Royal Thai Police, is a former accessory to murder and a former Buddhist monk. A video is mailed to him anonymously. It is a snuff film of Damrong, a woman he once loved obsessively. It turns out Damrong has masterminded her own death, and the recording of it, with proceeds going to her brother, a Buddhist monk.

Themes
Revenge is one of the novel's themes. Damrong takes revenge on her father by informing the police about one of her father's burglaries. The police in the countryside orchestrate her father's death, via the ""elephant game"" (the victim is placed into a spherical cage, of a type that elephants tend to start kicking, and thereafter stomp on when the sphere gets wedged into the corner of the arena). Damrong has prepared for her father's murder by bringing a camera with an expensive zoom, so that she can take detailed pictures of the execution.

Pagliacci was shot at Milan's La Scala opera house and on a movie sound stage. Georges Prêtre conducted the Orchestra and Choir of La Scala.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. It was also shown on Italian and U.S. television and brought Zeffirelli an Emmy Award for Best Director in the category of Classical Music Programming. In 2003, Pagliacci was re-released on DVD by Deutsche Grammophon (having earlier been released by Philips/Decca on DVD), paired with Cavalleria rusticana (also starring Plácido Domingo).

Plot
The story is set in southern Italy and recounts the tragedy of Canio, the lead clown (or pagliaccio in Italian) in a commedia dell'arte troupe, his wife Nedda, and her lover, Silvio. When Nedda spurns the advances of Tonio, another player in the troupe, he tells Canio about Nedda's betrayal. In a jealous rage Canio murders both Nedda and Silvio during a performance. Although Leoncavallo's opera was originally set in the late 1860s, Zeffirelli's production is updated to the period between World War I and World War II.

Production
The Italian television network RAI had originally wanted to broadcast a live performance of Franco Zeffirelli's 1981 productions of Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci from the stage of La Scala. Zeffirelli, however, requested to be allowed to film the productions as if they were movies instead. In part, because both operas starred popular tenor Plácido Domingo, Unitel agreed to help finance the project. Zeffirelli insisted that Canadian soprano Teresa Stratas play Nedda, even though she was not originally cast in the stage production. Over the course of only two days, the director filmed both works at the opera house when it was not in use. He had a wooden platform built over the front seats of the auditorium, where he placed his cameras to film the action onstage. He later did pick-up shots at an Italian film studio.

Soundtrack
For the movie's soundtrack, Georges Prêtre conducted the orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala in the opera house's orchestra pit, while each of the film's performers sang their own parts onstage while the cameras rolled. No audience, however, was present and it was recorded in segments. Plácido Domingo, who had frequently performed the role of Canio onstage since 1966, previously recorded the opera in 1971 under Nello Santi. Philips Records released the film's soundtrack on LP in 1985 and CD in 1990. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Opera Recording.

In a review of the soundtrack, the Montreal Gazette wrote: ""Sound effects are included, which lend to the singing a credibility that you do not always feel on recordings."" The article also praised Domingo and Statas' singing and noted that the original analog recordings of the movie were digitally remastered prior to the soundtrack's release. Although they were filmed together, the Pagliacci recording was originally released separately from the soundtrack for Cavalleria rusticana.

280,"Saint Tecwyn is the patron saint and founder of Llandecwyn in the Welsh county of Gwynedd.

Tecwyn (sometimes transliterated as Tegwyn - feminine version Tegwen) was a 6th-century Welsh saint who founded the church at Llandecwyn, having come to Wales early in the Age of the Saints. It is believed that Tecwyn was the brother of Saint Tanwg of Llandanwg, Saint Twrog of Maentwrog, Saint Tegai of Llandegai and Saint Baglan of Llanfaglan and Baglan.

According to Enwogion Cymru, he was the son of Ithel Hael o Lydaw of Brittany, and arrived in Britain with Saint Cadfan, in the time of Vortigern ""who procured wise men and divines from Gaul, now called France, to renovate Christianity in this Island, in consequence of the decay and failure that had befallen the faith in Christ.""  The Breton language at this time would have been very close to the Welsh of the period. He was a member of the college of Bardsey which was founded as a monastery in 516 AD.

The church of Llanfihangel-y-traethau, a few miles to the southwest of Llandecwyn, has a window depicting Saint Tecwyn and is the start of the Saint Tecwyn's Way, a pilgrimage route between the two churches.

281,"Kevin Niclas Mensah (; born 10 May 1991) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a full-back for the Danish Superliga club Brøndby IF.

Starting his career in Viborg FF, Mensah later moved to Esbjerg fB before joining Brøndby in 2017. Originally a forward, Mensah transitioned into a utility player while at Brøndby, starting out as a striker but later becoming a full-back due to a shortage of available players on the position. Under head coach Niels Frederiksen, Mensah has been utilised at both right and left wing-back, where his agility and attacking mentality have come to their right. In July 2019, he was appointed new vice-captain of the club.

Mensah has made appearances for various national youth teams of Denmark while at Viborg, gaining 26 total caps in which he scored four goals.

Career

Viborg FF
Mensah played his first years of youth football for Søndermarkens IK in his hometown Viborg. When he was 15 he signed with Viborg FF after being part of talent project FK Viborg.

In 2008, he trained regularly with the Danish Superliga squad for Viborg FF, and on 2 May 2009, at 17 years of age, he scored his first goal for the team, in a 2–0 win over Thisted FC in the Danish second tier. The day before his 18th birthday, he was permanently promoted to the first team. He had previously been on trial at Premier League clubs Arsenal and Newcastle United for several laps despite his young age.

On 30 June 2011, his contract with Viborg FF expired, and a few days before he went on a trial with FC Nordsjælland without this materialising in a contract offer. Therefore, Mensah returned to Viborg FF to keep his physical shape straight together with former teammates. When he still had not received any offers from clubs at the beginning of the next season, he started playing as an amateur for Viborg FF. In August 2011, the club offered him a new professional contract, which meant that he signed a two-year deal with the Viborg FF in October 2011.

After Viborg FF reached promotion to the Superliga in 2013, Mensah signed another two-year contract extension keeping him in his hometown club until 30 June 2015.

Esbjerg fB
On 2 February 2015 Esbjerg fB signed Mensah. Originally, he would transfer to Esbjerg in the summer of 2015. However, Viborg and Esbjerg reached an agreement on a transfer on the last day of the January transfer window, as Viborg had found a replacement for him in the meantime.

On 2 March 2015, Mensah made his debut for Esbjerg in a Danish Superliga match against AaB, coming in as a 72nd-minute substitute for Mohammed Fellah.

Brøndby IF
On 23 January 2017, Brøndby IF confirmed that they had reached an agreement with Esbjerg for the transfer of Mensah.

In the last match of the 2017–18 season, Mensah suffered a torn ACL, ruling him out for seven to nine months following surgery on his knee.

After making his return in February 2019, and following the departure of right back Johan Larsson to EA Guingamp, Brøndby manager Alexander Zorniger opted to move Mensah to right back to accommodate the shortage of backs in the squad, which meant that he would serve as the backup to Jens Martin Gammelby. Due to Anthony Jung's poor form at left back, Mensah was utilised in this position too in the 2018–19 season with great success.

In July 2019, he was appointed new vice-captain of the club.

Playing style
Mensah plays the ball with both his right-foot and left-foot, and has been described as a technical marvel, an elegant offensive player with a wonderful technique that makes him a crowd favorite in addition of a footspeed that makes him uncomfortable to handle for any defender.

Family
His brother Jeff Mensah also plays professional football. He holds both a Ghanaian passport and a Danish passport.

283,"Caroline Osgood Emmerton (1866–1942) was a wealthy philanthropist from Salem, Massachusetts, USA, who established The House of the Seven Gables as a combined historic site and settlement house in 1907.

With a fortune inherited from her grandfather, maritime trader John Bertram, Emmerton carried on her family's tradition of endowing and supporting charitable good works, including the Bertram Home for Aged Men, the Salem public library, the Seaman's Widow and Orphan Society, the Family Service Association, the Salem Fraternity Boys Club and the city's Public Welfare Society, as well as the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England), of which she was a founding member. By the age of twenty eight she was a board of director for the Charter St. Home now the North Shore Medical Center/Salem Hospital. In 1907, she joined with a group of women to explore forming a settlement house in Salem and to do ""experimental work"".  By the following year, these women had begun to offer classes in sewing and other crafts and activities in an old Seaman's Bethel next to the historic Turner-Ingersoll Mansion, which was also known as the house that Nathaniel Hawthorne had written about in his novel The House of the Seven Gables. In 1908, she bought the Turner-Ingersoll house, and in 1910 the organization opened in its hybrid form. She hired Joseph Everett Chandler as the architect.

Like many American settlement house founders and workers, Emmerton saw exposure to historic environments and stories as a way for new immigrants to absorb democratic values and practices. ""If, as is generally conceded, the settlements do the best Americanization work,"" she wrote, ""should not this settlement excel whose home is the ancient House of Seven Gables, the foundations of which were laid by the first immigrants who came here long ago, strangers in a strange land?"" Over time, Emmerton continued to expand and reorganize the compound, eventually moving four additional colonial-era buildings to the site and working with the colonial revival architect Joseph Everett Chandler to restore them.

284,"To classify postoperative outcomes for epilepsy surgery, Jerome Engel proposed the following scheme, the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale, which has become the de facto standard when reporting results in the medical literature:
 Class I: Free of disabling seizures
 Class II: Rare disabling seizures (""almost seizure-free"")
 Class III: Worthwhile improvement
 Class IV: No worthwhile improvement

History

Surgery for epilepsy patients has been used for over a century, but due to technological restrictions and insufficient knowledge of brain surgery, this treatment approach was relatively rare until the 1980s and 90s.  Prior to the 1980s, no classification system existed due to the lack of operations performed up until the time. As surgery as a treatment grew more prevalent, a classification system became a necessity. The appropriate evaluation of patients following epilepsy surgery is extremely important, as medical professionals must know the appropriate course of action to follow in order to achieve seizure freedom for patients.  Accordingly, the Engel classification guidelines were devised by UCLA neurologist Jerome Engel Jr. in 1987 and made public at the 1992 Palm Desert Conference on Epilepsy Surgery. The Engel classification system has since become the standard in reporting postoperative outcomes of epilepsy surgery.

Overview

In Engel's 1993 summary of the 1992 Palm Desert Conference on Epilepsy Surgery, he annotated his classification system with more detail.  The annotation was as follows:
 Class I: Seizure free or no more than a few early, nondisabling seizures; or seizures upon drug withdrawal only
 Class II: Disabling seizures occur rarely during a period of at least 2 years; disabling seizures may have been more frequent soon after surgery; nocturnal seizures
 Class III: Worthwhile improvement; seizure reduction for prolonged periods but less than 2 years
 Class IV: No worthwhile improvement; some reduction, no reduction, or worsening are possible

Advantages

The subjectivity of the Engel system leaves much of the postoperative class assignment process to the patients. While many have noted the disadvantages of a classification system where the patients are involved in determining the evaluation, others have praised it.  Proponents of the Engel classification guidelines argue that the patients are best able to perceive the worth of the operation because they are the ones experiencing the seizures before and after the treatment.

Disadvantages

As is the case for all current methods of reviewing epilepsy surgery outcomes, the Engel classification system has subjective components. A ""disabling seizure"" is subjective and can vary in definition from person to person. While one epileptic experiencing a seizure when driving a car may find the seizure ""disabling,"" the same magnitude of seizure may be interpreted as mild, and thus ""nondisabling,"" by an epileptic resting in bed. Every class other than class I is also subjective because there is no quantitative definition of what determines a rare occurrence or method to measure worthwhileness. One doctor and patient may consider 2 seizures in a year as a rare occurrence while another doctor may consider 10 in a year as rarely occurring. The worthwhileness of the operation is ambiguous because worth can be interpreted differently by various patients and healthcare professionals. Keeping those caveats in mind, most neurologists and neurosurgeons who specialize in epilepsy would most likely agree, as would many epileptics and even laypeople, that any seizure that leads to a period of status epilepticus (seizure activity, especially of the tonic-clonic, or grand mal, type, for longer than about five to ten minutes, or more- some now say it should be as little as two- without an intervening return to normal, or any repeat seizures without a return to consciousness) is a medical emergency, objectively a major problem, and cannot be considered a satisfactory outcome (unless perhaps if the person had a fatal or very severe form of a neurodegenerative syndrome or other disease where such severe repeat seizures are not unusual, and there are a number of these diseases; even then, such an outcome is usually still not a cure, just an amelioration of a fatal condition or a very disabling condition). Continuing to have to endure a large number of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) over a period of days, months, or even over the course of a year or two, would make it impossible to drive and very hard to hold a job away from home entailing much stress, and would pose limits on one's abilities to safely carry out the activities of daily living without at least some monitoring or assistance.

The Engel classification system has been thought of as a cross-sectional grading system by medical professionals because it does not account for long term changes in patients.  It has been proposed that it would be more beneficial to reevaluate patients on an annual basis, and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) devised a separate rating scale in 2001 that reevaluates patients on every annual anniversary of their surgery. The ILAE also developed their system in hopes of avoiding many of the subjective components found in the Engel system.

At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, he was eliminated in the repechages of the C-2 1000 m event while finishing ninth in the C-1 1000 m event.

Edwards grew up paddling at the Carleton Place Canoe Club (the oldest continuing flat water racing canoe club in Canada) in Carleton Place, Ontario, and became the first Olympic competitor from that club. He competed in C-1 1000m and C-2 1000m at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.

Edwards served as the Domestic Development Director at CanoeKayak Canada (CKC), then known as the Canadian Canoe Association, from 1999 until 2015. In that role, Edwards oversaw a period of significant evolution in the sport in Canada and around the world. Under Edwards, the number of racing clubs and the number of participants in the sport in Canada grew by an unprecedented amount. Edwards also initiated CKC’s Aboriginal Paddling Initiative and the PaddleALL program for paddlers with disabilities, and championed the expansion of opportunities for women in canoeing.
 
Edwards has also had significant influence on the sport internationally, serving as a member of the Board of the International Canoe Federation and as Chair of the ICF’s Paracanoe Committee. Edwards was the driving force behind acceptance of Paracanoe into the Paralympic Games, and his committee is charged with expanding the accessibility of the sport on a worldwide basis. In recognition for his work in Canada and internationally, he received a Lifetime Achievement honour at the 2016 World Paddle Awards.

Concurrent with his employment at CKC, Edwards enjoyed a long career in politics, serving as a municipal councillor for Ramsay Ward in Mississippi Mills, Ontario for more than 17 years. He held that position until 2018.

287,"The Potter Building is a building in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. The building occupies a full block along Beekman Street with the addresses 38 Park Row to its west and 145 Nassau Street to its east. It was designed by Norris G. Starkweather in a combination of the Queen Anne and neo-Grec styles, as an iron-framed structure.

The Potter Building employed the most advanced fireproofing methods that were available when the building was erected between 1883 and 1886. These features included rolled iron beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls, tile arches, and terracotta. The Potter Building was also one of the first iron-framed buildings, and among the first to have a ""C""-shaped floor plan, with an exterior light courtyard facing Beekman Street. The original design remains largely intact.

The building replaced a former headquarters of the New York World, which was built in 1857 and burned down in February 1882. It was named for its developer, the politician and real estate developer Orlando B. Potter. The Potter Building originally served as an office building with many tenants from the media and from legal professions. It was converted into apartments from 1979 to 1981. The Potter Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1996 and is also a contributing property to the Fulton–Nassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2005.

Site 
The Potter Building is in the Financial District of Manhattan, just east of New York City Hall, City Hall Park, and the Civic Center. The building abuts Park Row for about  to the west, Beekman Street for  to the south, and Nassau Street for about  to the east. The northern wall abuts 41 Park Row on the same block for  The Morse Building and 150 Nassau Street are across Nassau Street, while 5 Beekman Street is across Beekman Street. The corner of Park Row and Beekman Street is at an acute angle. The Potter Building's addresses include 35–38 Park Row, 2–8 Beekman Street, and 138–145 Nassau Street.

Design 
The 11-story Potter Building is arranged in a mixture of styles, including the Queen Anne, neo-Grec, Renaissance Revival, and Colonial Revival styles. As a result, it stands out from the surrounding buildings. The Potter Building's architect, Norris Garshom Starkweather, was known for designing churches and villas in the mid-Atlantic states. The building measures  tall from sidewalk to roof, with finials extending upward another . The original design remains mostly intact.

The Potter Building employed the most advanced fireproofing methods available at the time of construction, due to its predecessor having burned down. This included the use of rolled iron beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls, as well as tile arches and terracotta. Five iron companies provided the material. The fireproofing is insulated by the brick-and-terracotta facade. The Potter Building, characterized by architectural historian Robert A. M. Stern as a ""textbook case for fire retardation"", was the last major building to be supported by load-bearing walls, which would have been unnecessary in light of the iron superstructure.

Form 
The Potter Building is U-shaped, with a ""light court"" within the two arms of the ""U"", facing outward toward Beekman Street. The building is one of the city's oldest extant structures with a light court. The Real Estate Record and Guide said that ""the rooms on each side are made symmetrical in spite of the irregularity of the lot; the irregularity, of course, appearing in the court itself"". A writer for the Fireman's Herald stated that the court split the facade so that ""it looks almost like two buildings"". There is a fire escape in the middle of the light court.

Facade 
At the time of the Potter Building's construction, the facades of many 19th-century early skyscrapers consisted of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, midsection, and capital. The base comprises the bottom two stories, the midsection included the middle seven stories, and the capital was composed of the top two floors. The base has an iron facade and the remaining stories have a red brick and terracotta facade. Each side has similar ornamentation, containing column capitals, pediments, corbels, panels, and segmental arches made of terracotta. The ornamental detail is elaborately designed in the classical style and includes massive capitals atop the vertical piers, as well as triangular and swans'-neck pediments. 

The piers divide the facades into multiple bays, which each contain two windows on each floor. The piers, clad with brick above the second floor, are  wide at the base, with a uniform width for the building's entire height, but range in thickness from  at the first floor to  at the eleventh floor. They contain concealed flues that ventilate the gases from the building's furnaces into hidden chimneys underneath the finials atop each pier. The lintels on the upper stories, clad with terracotta, consist of four parallel wrought-iron beams with a width of   between flanges. The lintel beams sit atop iron plates embedded within the masonry of each pier and anchored with a twisted iron strap.

Because of the presence of elevator lobbies at the northern end of the building, the northernmost bays on Park Row and Nassau Street are wider. At Park Row and Beekman Street, a 270-degree-wide column rounds out the corner.

The Potter Building is among the oldest remaining buildings in New York City to retain architectural terracotta. The terracotta was sculpted by the Boston Terra Cotta Company and was more highly detailed than in other contemporary buildings. At the time, there were no terracotta companies in New York City, and four other firms competed to supply the building's terracotta. The structure ultimately included  of terracotta. Boston Terra Cotta Company superintendent James Taylor supervised the placement of the terracotta. The fourth and eighth floors contain windows ornamented with terracotta segmental arches; the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth-story windows contain terracotta corbels; and the eleventh-story windows have terracotta hoods.

Features 
The foundation walls of the Potter Building were  thick and sunken to a depth of . The underlying bedrock layer was more than  below the ground, so the foundations were placed on separate pier footings. The site is  above groundwater. During the construction of the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line () underneath Beekman Street in 1915, the southern elevation was underpinned using concrete-and-steel tubes sunk to a depth of , underneath the groundwater level.

The exterior columns are made of iron. All of the above-ground floors were built on girders made of rolled iron. The girders were  thick and range from  long. The floor beams,  thick, sit atop the flanges of each girder; their centers are set  apart, and most of the beams have a uniform length of . Flat brick arches were placed within each set of floor beams and were leveled with concrete, brick, and stone aggregate. The floors were finished with wood, while the ceilings were finished in plaster.

Potter's original plans for the building were for the first floor to contain bank offices and for the upper floors to be used by other businesses. He wished for the Potter Building to be ""an ornament to the neighborhood"". Inside were originally 351 suites that could be used by up to 1,800 people at a time. The ceilings of each story are  high. The building's upper floors were later converted into apartments of  each, though the apartments retained the  walls.

History

Context
The Potter Building lot, and the adjoining lot immediately to its north (which is occupied by 41 Park Row), was the site of the Old Brick Church of the Brick Presbyterian Church, built in 1767-1768 by John McComb Sr. Starting in the early 19th century and continuing through the 1920s, the surrounding area grew into the city's ""Newspaper Row""; several newspaper headquarters were built on Park Row, including the New York Times Building, the Park Row Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the New York World Building. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street. When the Brick Presbyterian Church congregation moved uptown to Murray Hill in 1857, Orlando B. Potter, a politician and a prominent real estate developer at the time, purchased the southern half of the Old Brick Church lot. Potter erected a five-story Italianate stone building on the lot for $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ); it became the first headquarters of the New York World, which was established in 1860. Potter purchased the building outright in 1867.

A fire broke out in the World building around 10:00 p.m. on January 31, 1882, supposedly because of a draft of wind from the nearby Temple Court Building. The fire destroyed much of the block within a few hours, killing six people and causing more than $400,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ); The World building was said to have ""made itself notorious the country over for burning up in the shortest time on record"", and it took a week to examine the wreckage, Several days after the fire, the Real Estate Record and Guide said that ""the ground is so valuable that it will no doubt be immediately built upon"".

Construction 

Potter sought to replace the burned-down edifice with a fireproof structure, having incurred more than $200,000 of losses (equivalent to $ million in ) in addition to loss of income. By mid-February 1882, Potter was planning to construct an 11-story building at the site of the old World building, which he specified should be fireproof. In 1883, Starkweather presented plans for the structure, of which the first two stories would have an iron facade and the remainder would have a brick facade. Potter decided to defer construction for one year due to the high cost of acquiring materials. 

Construction of the foundation started in April 1883. To test the relative strength of iron versus wooden floor beams, Potter built two small, nearly-identical structures, one with each material. After setting them on fire for two to three days, Potter determined that the iron structure was more suitable for use, since the iron floor suffered little damage compared to the totally-burned wooden floor. Plans for the Potter Building were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in July 1883, at which point it was supposed to cost $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). 

Construction was underway by mid-1884. Workers were hired by the day, rather than contracted for the entire project. Since the World building fire had occurred during the construction of Potter's 750 Broadway building in NoHo, further uptown, workers from the 750 Broadway project were also contracted to work on the Potter Building. Construction was delayed in May 1884 due to a bricklayers' strike, and the costs increased to $1.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Work was also delayed by a painters' and carpenters' strike in 1885. The building was completed in June 1886. So involved was Potter in the selection of terracotta, he founded the New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company with his son-in-law Walter Geer. An 1888 brochure for the company stated that the Potter Building was ""an example of the best use of terra-cotta, both for constructive and ornamental purposes"".

Use 

At the time of its completion, the Potter Building was among the tallest in the area, towering above every other structure except the New York Tribune Building. The Boston Globe called the Potter Building ""the tallest straight-wall building in the world"". The 1892 King's Handbook of New York City stated that newspapers, magazines, insurance companies, and lawyers occupied 200 offices within the building. The newspaper tenants included The Press, a Republican Party-affiliated penny paper, as well as The New York Observer. The Potter Building was also occupied by paper manufacturers Peter Adams Company and Adams & Bishop Company, the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association insurance company, and the Otis Elevator Company. In addition, Potter occupied the top floor, and his New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company also had offices in the building.

Potter died in 1894, and the building was given over to his estate. O.B. Potter Properties acquired the building from Potter's estate in 1913. The Potter Building, along with some of the Potter estate's other properties (such as the Empire Building), was sold in 1919 to the Aronson Investing Company. The building's ownership was then transferred several times within a decade: the Parbee Realty Corporation acquired the structure in 1923, followed by A.M. Bing & Son in 1929, and the 38 Park Row Corporation in 1931, before Parbee re-acquired the Potter Building the following year. The Seaman's Bank for Savings acquired the structure at a foreclosure auction in 1941, and four years later, sold it to Beepark Estates. Tenants throughout this time included the United States Housing Authority, accountants, and lawyers. The 38 Park Row Corporation purchased the building in 1954.

The New York World and Tribune buildings immediately to the north were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, and Pace College (later Pace University) built 1 Pace Plaza on the site of the latter. The university also acquired the Potter Building and other nearby buildings in 1973, with plans to destroy them and build an office tower. These plans did not proceed and Pace sold the building in 1979 to a joint venture named 38 Park Row Associates, composed of Martin Raynes and the East River Savings Bank. 38 Park Row Associates converted the building into residential cooperatives and gave it to the 38 Park Row Residence Corporation in 1981. 

Following the residential conversion, a structural engineer noted that the facade had ""significant deterioration particularly in the mortar jointings"". The Potter Building's co-op board subsequently arranged for a renovation of the facade in 1992-1993, to be carried out by Siri + Marsik and Henry Restoration. The Potter Building, along with the Manhasset Apartments and 110 East 42nd Street, was made a New York City designated landmark on September 21, 1996. A controversy ensued in 1999 when the Blimpie restaurant at the Potter Building's ground level decided to place outdoor seating on Nassau Street, which had recently been converted from a weekday-only pedestrian zone into a full-time pedestrian plaza. Residents of the Potter Building complained that the seating violated a city ordinance on sidewalk cafes. In 2005, the Potter Building was designated as a contributing property to the Fulton–Nassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district.

Critical reception 
Lower Manhattan's late-19th century skyscrapers generally received mixed reception, and the Potter Building was especially criticized by professional architectural journals. A Real Estate Record and Guide writer remarked in 1885 that ""there is not an interesting or refined piece of detail in the whole building"". The critic also said that the building's design focused too much on its vertical aspect, though this contrasted with the opinions of other contemporary critics, who generally saw vertical emphasis favorably. In 1889, a writer for the same magazine compared the Potter Building with the Times Building at 41 Park Row, saying that the Potter Building's architect ""contrived to make [it] appear at once monotonous and uneasy"".

There were also positive reviews of the design. An 1885 Carpentry and Building article stated that the building was ""one of the most conspicuous new buildings in the lower part of New York City"", because of its juxtaposition of iron with brick and terracotta. The King's Handbook described the Potter Building as being among the city's ""great and illustrious monuments of commercial success"", while an 1899 architecture guidebook said that the Potter Building's ""design is unusual and perhaps excessive in detail, but has great interest in the disposition of its masses."" Later, in 1991, New York Times writer David W. Dunlap described the Potter Building as ""almost hallucinatory in its Victorian encrustation"". Architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit characterized the Potter Building as ""distinguished above all by its ruggedly picturesque red brick and cast-iron-clad outer walls abundantly trimmed with terra-cotta"".

290,"Rienzi Plantation House is a historic mansion located at 215 East Bayou Road in Thibodaux, Louisiana.

While it gives the impression of dating to c.1840, it is believed that the house was built between 1814 and 1825.

Rienzi plantation house is located directly across Bayou Lafourche from the town of Thibodaux. Despite the proximity of a modern shopping center, the house enjoys a historic setting due to the large live oaks on the property. Two of the oaks are registered in the Live Oak Society.

The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 31, 1980.

Architecture
The house is significant both historically and architecturally and was built in the ""American Style"" with center hallways, exterior wall fireplaces with great emphasis placed on balance and symmetry.  This is in contrast with the earlier ""Creole Style"" with rooms arranged en suite with no halls, interior fireplaces and the interior function of the room-defining the placement of windows and doors rather than a more symmetrical plan.  However, Rienzi shows a transition from the early style with its primary floor being on the second level and the exposed rafters on the downstairs gallery.   The house is thought to be built between 1814 and 1825 is almost square in plan with five bays on each side, measuring approximately 70' by 72'. It is built in the peripteral style, surrounded by galleries with brick pillars on the lower story and wooden pillars on the upper story. The ceilings of the first floor are 10' and 14' on the second story.  The walls of the house are brick and lumber used for roof rafters, floor joists, etc. are thought to pit-sawn and employ timber framing techniques, i.e. mortise and tenon joints with pegs. The majority of the lumber is cypress with flooring made of long leaf pine.  The most unique feature of the house are the central hallways placed in a cruciform plan on each floor. On the lower floor, the halls were originally open to the outside through brick arches, that not only provided access but structurally acted as a relieving or displacing arch, due to the weight of the brick structure. These have been enclosed with doorways in the early 1850s. It has been stated that the first floor was used to stable animals but with four fireplaces on the ground floor the use was for humans.  The two front rooms on the upper floor have slip head windows.

It is believed that the house has had significant renovations around 1850, 1900 and 1940 as both style and technology motivated owners to make changes. The house is currently undergoing a restoration (beginning in 2012) with a focus restoring the house to its earlier look. Though the house has some Greek Revival detail, (it actually pre-dates that period) the style of the house has been called Tuscan Revival. The handsome double front staircase was probably added during the 1850s renovation though many believe it was added in the 1930s. Several photos beginning in the 1870s show the double staircase intact. The monumental door surrounds have diamond-shaped ornaments, sidelights and transoms. A modern kitchen wing is located to the rear of the house. Of the many plantation houses in the Lafourche Bayou region, Rienzi Plantation is the only example of the fully developed peripteral mode. Moreover, it is one of the very few examples in the Deep South of a plantation house with a cruciform hall plan.

History

Rienzi Plantation House sits on property that is believed to be the first Spanish Land grant of Henry Schuyler Thibodeaux, the namesake of the City of Thibodaux.  The grant was made by Baron Carondelet in approximately 1792. After the Louisiana purchase, Thibodeaux confirmed that he both inhabited and cultivated the property 10 years prior to the purchase.  There is some evidence that a two-story wooden four bay house existed adjacent to the existing house and this is believed to be Thibodeaux's house.  (Thibodeaux well after the sale of the property became the 5th Governor of Louisiana.)  In 1814 the plantation was sold to Henry Fields, a prominent businessman, and architect.  It is believed that Fields is responsible for the house that exists today and his architectural skills enabled him to construct a house that exhibited non-typical futures of houses of that time.  In 1825. the plantation was sold to Henry Johnson, Governor of Louisiana at the time of his purchase.  He sold the property to Thomas Bibb in 1835, the second governor of Alabama and it is under his ownership that the plantation was first called Rienzi.  It is believed that the name comes from the novel and Wagner opera about the 14th-century Italian patriot, that was extremely popular during the 1840s.

The next owner, Juan Ignacio de Egana, was probably the source of the romantic legend which has been widely publicized.  The legend details that the house was constructed by Spanish architects at the request of Spanish Queen Maria Louisa as a possible retreat for her in the event of a Spanish defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. The legend has it that her agent, Juan Ygnacio de Egana, took possession of the home (after Louisiana was ceded to France and sold to the United States) and proceeded to live in the house for nearly fifty years. However, the conveyance records indicate that Juan Ygnacio de Egana, whatever his connection with the Queen, owned the plantation in 1851 and his estate sold the property to Richard Allen in 1861.  The 1860 census lists the ""Estate of J.Y. de Agana"" as consisting of 2,799 acres and 306 slaves. Champomier in his sugar report calls this estate ""Riensy Plantation."" In 1859 this plantation produced 950 hogsheads of sugar, by far the most in Lafourche Parish.

Laborers on Rienzi  were some of the first to strike during the fall of 1887 in a movement organized by the Knights of Labor in Thibodaux and the surrounding parishes. During the violence that ensued, Rienzi's overseer was shot in the face, though not severely injured. When white vigilantes went on a shooting spree to end the strike, three victims of the massacre died on the plantation's grounds.

In 1896 Emile Morvant and J. B. Levert bought the plantation in a joint partnership.  Subsequently, J.B. Levert acquired the Morvants' interest in 1922 and formed the J.B Levert Land, Inc.  In 2004 it was gifted to Nicholls State University and in 2012 purchased by the current owner.  The house remains a private residence.

292,"There have been various cases of sexual abuse in the Diocese of Antigonish on the part of Roman Catholic clergy.

1950s cases
On 7 August 2009, Bishop Raymond Lahey announced that the Diocese of Antigonish had reached a $15 million settlement in a class action lawsuit filed by 125 victims of sexual abuse by Hugh Vincent MacDonald and other diocese priests dating from 1950 to 2009. The investigation began after David Martin committed suicide in April 2002, accusing in his suicide note MacDonald of sexually abusing him in the 1970s. Hugh MacDonald was charged with more than two dozen charges of sexual assaults against children and other members of his former parishes before he died in 2004. The settlement against the diocese was approved by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on 10 September 2009. In 2012 the diocese satisfied its legal obligations to pay out $15 million to the victims of sexual abuse, having to sell a large number of its properties, liquidating the bank accounts of many of its churches, and borrowing $6.5 million from private lenders to make the payout.

Allegations against Bishop Raymond Lahey
In September 2009, Bishop Raymond Lahey's laptop was seized upon his return to Canada, after having visited parts of Europe. Canada Border Services Agency officers had performed a random search of his computer, uncovering images that raised concerns. Following an investigation Lahey was charged with the importation and possession of child pornography, and he subsequently tendered his resignation as Bishop for the Diocese. Lahey is alleged to have responded to the allegations by stating that he had never abused a child, and that he would ""never have any sexual interest in a person under 18"".

Subsequent to his arrest, allegations emerged that Lahey had previously been brought to the attention of former St. John's archbishop Alphonsus Liguori Penney in regard to child pornography allegations in the 1980s.

On 21 November 2009 Pope Benedict XVI named Brian Joseph Dunn as the Bishop of the Diocese of Antigonish.  Archbishop of Halifax Anthony Mancini had served as Apostolic Administrator from September 2009 until Bishop Dunn's installation on 25 January 2010.

Lahey pleaded guilty to the charges on 4 May 2011. He requested imprisonment, surrendering his right to bail. On 4 January 2012, he was sentenced to 15 months of prison time and 24 months of probation. However, because he had maspent 8 months in pre-trial custody, he was given time served and was discharged on the same day. This occurred as a result of a law that was repealed by the federal government in 2010; it had allowed judges to give 2-for-1 credit for time served. This was only possible in Lahey's case because he was charged in 2009, before the law was repealed.

On 16 May 2012, it was announced that Raymond Lahey had been defrocked by a decree by Pope Benedict XVI.

In Canadian literature
 Canadian writer Linden MacIntyre, fictionalized the ongoing events of the scandal in his award-winning novel The Bishop's Man, which was published in 2009. The novel's guilt-ridden protagonist is a Roman Catholic priest and former fixer for the Diocese of Antigonish named Fr. Duncan MacAskill. After years of quietly burying potential scandals involving the Diocese's priests, Fr. MacAskill has been assigned by his Bishop to a remote parish on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia and ordered to maintain a low profile.

296,"Peg Leg Joe was a sailor who led slaves through the Underground Railroad to freedom. He may have been a real person or composite of people but there is no reliable historical evidence of his existence. As his name suggests, he had a prosthesis for his right leg. 

Peg Leg Joe is widely credited for authoring the song ""Follow the Drinkin' Gourd"", which was supposedly about his working the fields in Whynott, Indiana. It is likely that Americans sang the tune in the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century. The lyrics were first published by Lee Hays in 1947.
	
In the children's book Follow the Drinking Gourd by Jeanette Winter, Peg Leg Joe would pretend to be a carpenter at a targeted plantation. There he would teach the slaves ""Follow the Drinking Gourd"", which contained a code leading the slaves to freedom along the Underground Railroad. He is also referred to as a sailor who visited plantations north of Mobile, Alabama around 1859 to teach local slaves his song, after which many would disappear from the plantations.

297,"HMS Shelburne was the American letter of marque schooner Racer, built in Baltimore in 1811 and captured by the British in 1813. She served on the American coast, capturing the American brig Frolic. She also captured some merchantmen and was sold in Britain in 1817.

Letter of Marque
Racer commissioned in August 1812, under Captain Daniel Chaytor and first lieutenant Thomas West. She was a trader, and made one voyage to Bordeaux, leaving Baltimore in August 1812 and returning in January 1813 with a cargo of brandy, dry goods, and the like. She sailed for Bordeaux again in March, with a cargo of coffee, cotton, and sugar.

Battle of Rappahannock River

On 13 April 1813, Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, consisting of , , , , , Mohawk and  pursued four schooners into the Rappahannock River in Virginia. The British sent 17 boats 15 miles upriver before capturing their prey.

One of the schooners, Dolphin, had been on a privateering cruise; consequently she carried 98 men and 12 guns. Under her captain, W.S. Stafford, she fought for some two hours before she struck. In the action the British reported they lost two killed and eleven wounded. American newspapers at first claimed that the British had lost 50 men, later reporting that British losses were two boats sunk with nineteen killed and forty wounded.  Stafford placed his losses at six killed and ten wounded. 

The British took at least three of the schooners into service. There was already an  in service so Racer, of six guns and 36 men, became Shelburne. Lynx became .  retained her name and became a tender commanded by a Lieutenant George Hutchinson. Lastly, it is not clear what became of Arab, of seven guns and 45 men, which too had put up some resistance. It was difficult for the British to free Arab and though they eventually succeeded, the vessel was apparently badly damaged and was not commissioned for British service. She was taken to Halifax where the Vice-Admiralty Court condemned her as a prize. In July 1814, prize money remitted from Halifax for Racer, Lynx, Arab and a number of other vessels, was paid.
 
On 29 April 1813, boats from Dolphin, together with boats from Mohawk, Fantome, Highflyer and Racer, which had not yet been renamed, went up the Chesapeake Bay  to Frenchtown to destroy five American ships and stores; they also purchased provisions for the squadron from the locals. This took until 3 May 1813 to complete. On the way back, a battery fired on the British from the shore; a landing party destroyed the battery. The Admiralty would later issue the clasp ""28 April Boat Service 1813"" for the Naval General Service Medal for the action.

British service
The Admiralty bought Racer for £1,940.11.5d (amended figure) and the British named her for the town of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, commissioning her under Lieutenant David Hope. They also armed her with ten 12-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns.

During 1813 Shelburne captured at least three merchant vessels. 
26 August: recaptured the Eliza. 
11 October: captured the Margelt.
12 October: captured the Fanny.

On 4 March 1814  and Shelburne sailed with a small convoy for Bermuda and the West Indies. Two days later they ran into a gale that scattered the vessels. Some, such as  were delayed in their arrival at Bermuda. 

After the two warships parted ways, Epervier encountered the . The subsequent engagement resulted in the capture of Epervier.

Having left Epervier, Shelburne joined the frigate Orpheus. Together, on 20 Apr 1814, they captured the 18-gun sloop USS Frolic. Outnumbered and outgunned, Frolic beat away to southward, making for the coast of Cuba. During the six-hour chase, Frolics men labored to lighten their ship. They cut away the starboard anchor and cast overboard the guns mounted on her port side. Eventually, Hope, seeing Frolic heel and realizing that she was unarmed on her port side, came up prepared to fire a broadside on Frolics unarmed side. 

Frolic surrendered to Shelburne as Orpheus approached; by this time the vessels were about 15 miles off Matanzas. The British took Frolic into service as Florida. She had been armed with two long 18-pounder guns and twenty 32-pounder carronades. The 18-pounder still on her turned out to be of British make and may have come from Macedonian.

The subsequent court martial acquitted Frolic's commander, Joseph Bainbridge, his officers and his crew, of the loss of his ship. Hope was promoted to commander in June, but remained with Shelburne. 

In October Lieutenant William Hamilton assumed command temporarily, while Hope served as an aide to Admiral Alexander Cochrane in Tonnant. Thereafter, Shelburne served in the blockade of New Orleans and assisted the Creek Indians who were British allies. In 1821 she shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton at the Battle of Lake Borgne on 14 December 1814.

In February 1815 Shelburne and , which was also a former American privateer, cruised off the Florida coast north of Havana.

Fate
On 22 June 1816 Shelburne arrived at Deptford. In October 1817 she was sold to Mr. Brown for £600.

300,"Sir Robert Wilmot, 1st Baronet (1708–1772) was an English servant of the Crown, Secretary to successive Viceroys of Ireland from 1740 to 1772, and after 1758 Secretary to the Lord Chamberlain of the Household. By 1750 several correspondents regarded him as ""the channel through which all Irish business, especially that concerning patronage, must flow"".

Life

Robert Wilmot was the elder son of Robert Wilmot (ca. 1674 - September 1738) of Osmaston Hall, and his younger brother was the judge John Eardley Wilmot (1709-1792). He graduated from Oxford University in 1729, and studied law at the Inner Temple.

About 1730 he became private secretary to William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. When Cavendish was appointed Viceroy of Ireland in 1737, Wilmot became the Viceroy's Deputy Resident Secretary in England. He was promoted to Resident Secretary in June 1740, serving twelve successive Viceroys until the year of his death in 1772. Wilmot acted as an intermediary for William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire in the complicated negotiations which led to Cavendish briefly serving as titular Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1756–57. He was rewarded in 1758, when Devonshire patronage helped him become Deputy Secretary, and subsequently Secretary, to the Lord Chamberlain of the Household.

Robert Wilmot's first marriage was childless. After his wife died in 1769, he married his mistress, mother of his illegitimate children. In October 1772 he was created a baronet, Wilmot of Osmaston. He was granted a special remainder to allow his eldest son Robert to succeed to the baronetcy.
The papers relating to his official activities are held at Derbyshire Record Office, with copies at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.

302,"General Charles Cadogan, 2nd Baron Cadogan (1684/5 – 24 September 1776) was an Anglo-Irish peer, soldier and Whig politician.

Early life
Cadogan was the younger son of Henry Cadogan of Liscarton, County Meath, and his wife, the former Bridget Waller, second daughter of the regicide Sir Hardress Waller. In 1726, he inherited his title on the death without male issue of his elder brother William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, whose titles, other than 1st Baron Cadogan, became extinct.

Career
He joined the Army, serving during the War of the Spanish Succession where he saw action at the Battles of Oudenarde and Malplaquet. His career benefited from his brother's close connection to the Army's Captain General the Duke of Marlborough. He rose, by 1715, to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Coldstream Guards. He was promoted Brigadier-General in 1735, Major-General in 1739, Lieutenant-General in 1745 and full General in 1761. Atterbury describes Cadogan as ""a bold, bad, boistrous, blustering, bloody, booby."".

He was given the Colonelcy of the 4th Foot in 1719, transferring in 1734 to be Colonel of the 6th Dragoons until 1742, when he transferred a second time to be Colonel of the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards, a position he then held until his death.

Later, he served as Governor of Sheerness between 1749 and 1752 and Governor of Gravesend and Tilbury Fort from 1752 until his death in 1776.

Political career
After being defeated in his election to become a Member of Parliament for Reading in 1715, he was returned as a Whig in a by-election in 1716. He acted in Parliament with his brother in support of Sunderland against Walpole and represented Reading until the 1722 election when he was beaten by Tories at Reading. However, was successful at a by-election at Newport, Isle of Wight (his brother being then governor of the Isle of Wight).

Upon his brother's death in 1726, he succeeded to his barony of Cadogan of Oakley, under special remainder, but not to the earldom, and gave up his seat in the House of Commons.

Personal life
On 25 July 1717, Cadogan was married to the heiress Elizabeth Sloane at the Church of St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London. Elizabeth was a daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, 1st Baronet, and the former Elizabeth Langley Rose. Together, they had one son:

 Charles Sloane Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan (1728–1807), who married the Hon. Frances Bromley, a daughter of Henry Bromley, 1st Baron Montfort. After her death, he married Mary Churchill, a daughter of Col. Charles Churchill and Lady Mary Walpole (a daughter of former Prime Minister Robert Walpole). They divorced in 1796.

Through his marriage to Elizabeth, the  Sloane estate in suburban Chelsea was transferred to the Cadogan family in 1753, which has been the basis of the family wealth ever since. Cadogan became Lord of the Manor of Chelsea.

Lady Cadogan died on 20 May 1768. At his death on 24 September 1776, he was the senior general in the British Army.

312,"Pornography: A Thriller is a 2009 American mystery/thriller film, written and directed by David Kittredge.

Pornography: A Thriller is a non-linear story in three parts, all revolving around the disappearance of fictional adult gay film actor Mark Anton (Jared Grey). The first act depicts Anton's final days in 1995, the second is about writer Michael Castigan (Matthew Montgomery) as he searches for the truth in 2009 about what happened to Anton, and the third revolves around 2009 adult film actor Matt Stevens's (Pete Scherer) attempt to make The Mark Anton Story, based in part on his dreams of what happened to Anton.

The film uses an unconventional structure, with actors playing multiple roles in different sections, and uses dream logic to tell its story through a subjective point of view. Because of this, it has been compared to the work of David Lynch (most notably Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive) and David Cronenberg (notably Videodrome).

Kittredge says about the structure, ""We wanted to replicate the dream logic of a nightmare. So even though we don’t spell everything out for the audience, the film is still a complete whole and has its own fully formed arc that’s hopefully a satisfying whole.""

Production
The film was shot in 16 days for under $200,000. And although much of the film takes place in New York City and Brooklyn, it was mostly shot in and around Los Angeles.

The film was shot primarily with Panasonic HVX200 cameras. One was outfitted with a PS Technik adapter, which gave the image a filmic depth of field and grain that emulated 16mm. There were a variety of other cameras used as well in different parts (mostly in a ""practical"" fashion, denoting footage that was shot in the story of the film), including the Panasonic DVX100a, a Sony Handycam, and an 80s-era Sony Video 8 camcorder (featured prominently in the film).

The 5.1 sound mix was done by Sonicpool in Hollywood and the HD color-correct and finishing was done at Postworks, New York.

Release
Pornography: A Thriller premiered at Newfest: the New York LGBT Film Festival in June 2009. It played at over 25 film festivals around the world, including Outfest, Frameline, Philadelphia QFest, and Reeling Chicago.

The film was theatrically released in the US on April 13, 2010, at the Cinema Village in New York City. The film was released theatrically in Germany by Bildkraft on July 9, 2010, and the UK by Peccadillo Pictures on August 27.

The film was released on DVD and iTunes in the United States by Wolfe Video July 13, 2010. The DVD features ten deleted or extended scenes, a commentary track featuring writer/director David Kittredge, producer Sean Abley and actors Matthew Montgomery, Pete Scherer and Jared Grey, and a behind-the-scenes featurette called ""Smile For the Camera"".

Digitally, the film was released in the United States on DVD and iTunes on August 30, 2010. The film was released on DVD in France by Optimale on August 31, 2010. Peccadillo Pictures also launched an aggressive online campaign for the film in the guise of a fake ""snuff film"" website, based on the plot points about a mysterious videotape and symbol; the site featured recut snippets of the film and spread virally.

The world television premiere on Logo Network was October 31, 2010.

Critical response
Pornography was very well received at several film festivals, and won awards at two.

Critics had polarized responses. ""Kind of pretentious.... Kind of amazing, too,"" was the summation in New York's L Magazine., who also named it ""The Citizen Kane of Gay Porn Ghost Stories"".  Reverse Shot lauded the ""well placed"" plot twists and ""nicely paced"" mystery, saying that it was ""impressively committed to its own vision and logic"". The Village Voice called it ""Ambitiously layered"" and ""Unabashedly arty and impressively shot"". Chuck Wilson of LA Weekly called the film ""a crazily ambitious debut thriller"" and ""Pornography marks Kittredge as filmmaker with a strong mind and a gift for drawing full-bodied performances from his actors"". Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it ""a deeply affecting and disturbing thriller that has earned Kittredge comparisons to David Lynch and David Cronenberg."" Matthew Sorrento's positive review in Film Threat states ""When handled well, dread can extend far beyond our conscious need for order – Lovecraft himself held that our fear is strongest when we fear the unknown. Pornography approaches this conceit without the timidity of lesser efforts."" He ends with ""I recommend all fans of the bizarre have a look.""

315,"Sick of Sarah was a rock music band based in Minneapolis. Their ""strong-voiced punky girl-rock"" has drawn comparisons to bands such as Dollyrots and Tegan and Sara. Among their claims to fame, they are one of the most torrented bands of all time: the band was featured on the BitTorrent Artist Spotlight, and 1.7 million copies were downloaded. Because their album 2205 was automatically downloaded with BitTorrent software, it was dubbed the ""spam album"", but the band benefited greatly from the publicity.

History
The band formed in 2005 with Abisha Uhl (lead vocals and guitar), Katie Murphy (vocals and lead guitar), Jessie Farmer (bass and vocals), and Brooke Svanes (drums).  The inspiration for the band's name came from a former roommate of Uhl's named Sarah who had grown tired of her name, complaining that she was ""sick of Sarah"".

When Jamie Holm (deceased 2021) joined Sick of Sarah as a bassist in 2008, Farmer switched to playing guitar. Later that same year, the band was chosen as the ""best emerging artist"" at Summerfest. After Svanes left Sick of Sarah in 2010, Jessica Forsythe replaced her on drums.
As of 2018 Sick Of Sarah has split up.

The village was the site of the farm and manor house belonging to the Mickiewicz family, probably the birthplace in 1798 of Adam Mickiewicz, when (following the Third Partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth  in 1795) the area lay within the Russian Empire.

In 1806 the lands passed to the Stypułkowski family, and in 1831 were confiscated by the imperial government as punishment for Lucjan Stypułkowski's participation in the November Uprising. Between 1918 and 1939 the village was in the Second Polish Republic, and in 1927 a monument to Mickiewicz was placed there. The manor and its surroundings were reconstructed in 1996.

329,"""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"" is the thirteenth episode of the fourteenth season and the 208th overall episode of Comedy Central's series South Park. It originally aired on November 10, 2010; and was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker.

In its original American broadcast on November 10, 2010, ""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"" was watched by 3.249 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest viewed scripted show. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49.

In this episode, Cartman shows himself to be even more evil than the dark lord, Cthulhu, as he punishes his former partners in Coon & Friends. Kenny is wrestling with the weight of his own super power through his alter-ego, Mysterion.

The episode continues from previous South Park episodes ""Coon 2: Hindsight"" and ""Mysterion Rises"" and reveals the identities of all of Coon and Friends.

The episode was rated TV-MA-LV in the United States.

Plot
Bradley Biggle, as Mint Berry Crunch is summarizing the previous episode in a comic book format.  The boys raise concern over Mint Berry Crunch's super powers, as they do not accept ""the power of mint and berry with a satisfying tasty crunch"" as a legitimate super power. While discussing powers, the boys ask Mysterion about his power. Mysterion boldly states that ""I can't die."" The other boys, who are only imagining their powers, casually take note. Mysterion sees that they are not taking him seriously, and with mounting frustration, he elaborates to them that ""I really, really can't die."" He tries to remind them that they witnessed him being stabbed to death the night before, but the other boys do not remember at all. In an attempt to prove his point, Mysterion shouts at them to remember, pulls out a handgun, and shoots himself in the head, leaving the boys in utter shock. However, much to the annoyance of Mysterion, they later completely forget about it when everyone including himself returns for another meeting on good deeds.

After providing his own distorted summary of the story so far, Cartman (after using the ""LeBron James Technique"" to confuse his mother into not grounding him) arrives and lures the heroes outside, where he orders Cthulhu to banish them to a dark oblivion. Mint Berry Crunch runs away and pretends to be heroic by watching Judge Judy, while the rest of the heroes are transported to R'lyeh. With that done, Cartman has Cthulhu head to the Burning Man festival to massacre hippies. At R'lyeh, seeing death as his only potential escape back to Earth and save his friends, Mysterion commits suicide by jumping into a pit of deadly spikes (complaining about the pain of this particular manner of death as he does so). Kenny awakens back in his bed and dons his Mysterion outfit, setting off to learn more about Cthulhu and his own powers in order to save his friends. He goes to Henrietta's house, where she and the other Goth kids are complaining about Cthulhu not changing everything as they were made to believe, and claiming ""It's just like Obama"". Just then, Henrietta's mother comes in and tells her that her brother, who turns out to be Bradley, wants to play with them. Upon entering the room, Bradley sees Mysterion and runs back to his room to change into his Mint Berry Crunch outfit. Meanwhile, the Goth kids tell Mysterion that Cthulhu can only be killed by another immortal, meaning that Kenny is seemingly the only one who has the power to stop Cthulhu's rampage.

Followed by Mint Berry Crunch, Mysterion tracks down the Coon and Cthulhu as the latter have just finished massacring Justin Bieber and a number of his fans. After berating the Coon for re-making the world in his own image (something no superhero is meant to do), Mysterion challenges Cthulhu by offering him an easy win if he brings his friends back, only for Cthulhu to simply walk away after being influenced by the Coon's ""cute kitten"" act. A bright light descends from the air and a man appears inside, who reveals himself to be Bradley's biological father from a far away planet who sent his son to Earth to stop evil from taking over the Earth. Bradley, whose Mint Berry Crunch powers were actually real, manages to subdue Cthulhu, drag him back to the dimension from which he came, save the other heroes from oblivion, shut the hole which BP drilled into the Gulf of Mexico, and briefly return home to give the middle finger to his sister. With Cartman jailed at the Coon & Friends' secret base, Mint Berry Crunch vanishes in a flash of light as the rest of the heroes express surprise that Bradley really did have superpowers. Mysterion, disappointed that he did not learn anything about his true past and identity, says he is going to bed and shoots himself in the head. That night, his mother suddenly gives birth to another new baby Kenny. Wrapping him in an orange hoodie, she remarks to his father that they never should have gone to those cult meetings.

Cultural references
Like ""Coon 2: Hindsight"" and ""Mysterion Rises"" the third part heavily references the works of H. P. Lovecraft, especially the Cthulhu Mythos.

This episode also references the Merrie Melodies cartoon short Feed the Kitty, with Cartman acting as Pussyfoot and Cthulhu as Marc Antony in his ""cute kitten"" routine.

In his quest to ""make the world a better place"", the Coon (Eric Cartman's alter ego), persuades Cthulhu to destroy the Whole Food Market supermarket chain, which specializes in organic and healthy food. They attack the Burning Man festival, which is, according to Cartman, ""the biggest hippie festival in the world"". A news reporter at the site of the slaughter mistakes The Coon for ""Bruce Vilanch in a rat costume"", an assumption first made in ""The Coon"". Another target, and in Cartman's eyes, the ""most challenging and most evil opponent"", is Canadian singer Justin Bieber. The LeBron James Nike commercial is also spoofed again. Cartman tries to lure the boys out of his basement with promises of a double rainbow, coinciding with the popularity of the ""Double Rainbow"" viral video. The name of the song that Cartman sings while walking to his house is ""Faith"" by George Michael. At the end when Mint Berry Crunch discovers that he has powers, The NeverEnding Story theme song singer, Limahl, appears before him.

Reception

Broadcast and ratings
In its original American broadcast on November 10, 2010, ""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"" was watched by 2.786 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night, surpassing shows such as Psych, Terriers, Meet the Browns and The Ultimate Fighter in ratings. The episode received a 1.8 rating/3 share, meaning it was seen by 1.8 percent of the population, and 3 percent of people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode received a 3.4 rating/11 share. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 1.6 rating/5 share, falling two tenths in the ratings since the last episode.

Critical response
The episode received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave the episode a ""great"" score of 8.0 and said ""The Coon and Friends trilogy comes to an end in grand fashion, with epic battles, strange alliances, and secret origins revealed. It's a tale told in the finest comic book traditions, and it's one of the most creative episodes South Park has produced recently."" The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, a vast improvement over the C and C+ rating given to Coon 2: Hindsight and Mysterion Rises, stating that the episode was ""fleeter and funnier, it wasted less time on padded-out tangents, and it satisfactorily resolved the question of Kenny's immortality"" and called the episode ""as well-executed an ending as one could probably hope for here"". Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5, calling it an ""entertaining, fitting finish"", stating that it ""dropped all the things we hated about the first two parts"" and delivered a ""solid, fun half hour"", praising the twist ending, the portrayal of Cartman and how he ""believed he truly was making the world a better place"", as well as the death of Justin Bieber.

Home release
""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

341,"Jurassic Forest is a seasonal tourist attraction located on Highway 28 just north of Gibbons, Alberta, just minutes away from Edmonton, Alberta by vehicle. The facility is situated in a mature boreal forest setting and features more than 40 animatronic dinosaurs in their natural habitat. The dinosaurs can be easily viewed from wooden trails that lead through the forest. The trail system consists of two separate loops, the South Discovery trail and the North Discovery trail, each about  long. The trails are wheelchair friendly and are accessible in all types of weather conditions.

History
Jurassic Forest is an educational and entertainment centre that opened on July 30, 2010. When it opened, the facility featured a total of 42 animatronic dinosaurs, an interpretive centre, concession and gift shop area. In 2011, several facility enhancements were undertaken including the development of an upgraded concession area, enhanced playground area and the addition of three interactive educational displays inside the interpretive centre. A new dinosaur was also added to the North Discovery trail, as the Spinosaurus became the 43rd dinosaur to be featured at Jurassic Forest.

In 2012, the addition of three new Pachyrhinosaurus, and a Troodon highlighted the opening of the new season.

In 2013, the expansion of the discovery trails continued with the North and South trail extensions. ""From Scales to Fur"" is the theme of the south extension. Taking Flight"" is the theme of the north extension. Both trail extensions feature creatures that are not consistent with the dinosaur-only displays of the previous three years. With these new animals, the total number of displays is now 51 animals.

342,"Lee Vernon Stiff (February 4, 1949 - March 19, 2021) was an American mathematics education researcher; a professor in the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education and the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the College of Education at North Carolina State University; and the author of several mathematics textbooks. In his 72 years of living he wrote many books.

Stiff's father was ""a factory worker with only a third-grade education"". Stiff studied mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971, and went on to earn a master's degree from Duke University in 1974 and a doctorate in mathematics education from North Carolina State University in 1978. After teaching mathematics at the middle school and high school levels, and then holding a faculty position at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte beginning in 1978, he returned to NCSU in 1983.

From 2000 to 2002 Stiff was president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Under his leadership, the NCTM pushed for a greater emphasis on basic computational skills in elementary and secondary school mathematics education, and for an appropriate emphasis on conceptual understanding. Stiff rejected simple solutions to complex issues, saying that ""Back to basics is moving backward. Number-crunching alone is no longer enough."" Instead, Stiff has recommended better training and incentives for mathematics teachers, a teaching style that incorporates a variety of ways of looking at the same material, and an attitude that all students can learn mathematics regardless of their background.

In 1995 he was a Fulbright scholar in Ghana. In 2010 the NC State College of Education gave him their Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2015 he received the Benjamin Banneker Lifetime Achievement Award, in 2017 he was given the TODOS Iris M. Carl Leadership and Equity Award, and in 2019 he was honored with the NCTM Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2019, with Drs. Valerie Faulkner and Patricia Marshall, he wrote the critically important work, The Stories We Tell: Math, Race, Bias, and Opportunity, which ""...sits the ""gap problem"" on the doorsteps of schools and districts and off the backs of children and parents.""

343,"Adam's Grave was a Neolithic long barrow near Alton Barnes in Wiltshire, southwest England. Its remains have been scheduled as an ancient monument.

The barrow is considered to be of the Severn-Cotswold tomb type. These generally consist of long, precisely built trapezoidal earth mounds covering burial chambers, thus they are a type of chambered long barrow. The chamber, made of sarsen stones, contained partial human skeletons. An arrowhead was also recovered. There is a breast-shaped hill on the spot, with the remains of the barrow being  long and around  high with ditches on either side. It was partially excavated by John Thurnam in 1860. The area around Adam's Grave has a high density of long barrows and is important because of its archaeological potential.

The arrangement of stones around the site suggests there was once a kerb or forecourt. They are known as ‘Old Adam and ‘Little Eve’ and are near the original entrance to the barrow. According to folklore the barrow is the grave of a giant, and his ghost has been reported. Associations with the nearby monument at Avebury have also been suggested.

In the Anglo-Saxon period it was known as ""Woden's Barrow"" (Old English ""Wōdnesbeorġ"") and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records two battles at the site in 592 and 715.

344,"Merdø is an island in Arendal municipality in Agder county, Norway.  The  island lies along the Skagerrak coast, near the entrance to the Galtesundet, the main shipping channel leading to the town of Arendal on the mainland. The islands of Tromøy and Hisøya lie to the north and northwest.  The small islands of Ærøya and Havsøya lie to the southwest.  A part of the island is included in Raet National Park.

History
Graves from the Iron Age exist in two places on the island: Lakseberget and Støttavla.  Historical records show a permanent settlement on Merdø dating back to at least the 1300s, and that the settlement occurred in close association with the ever increasing shipping traffic on the Skagerrak.  Merdø is marked as an outport on every old Dutch maritime map since 1580, and it was one of the most important ports along the Skagerrak. Merdø harbor is located on the northern shore of the island of Merdø, facing the village of Revesand on the island of Tromøy, about  to the north.  The inn, customs station, and shipyard on Merdø are mentioned in writings from the 16th century. Later, a school and shops were established on the island.

There is a well-preserved old house which is now the Merdøgaard museum, which belongs to the Aust-Agder museum in Arendal. There are two compass designs cut into the mountains with the date 1654.  There are also two cannons that were placed on the island in the 1700s for the defense of the town of Arendal that still can be seen.

In the 19th century, fishermen and their families lived on the island along the sea. In 1900, there were 26 inhabited houses with a total of 144 residents. At the beginning of the 20th century, the sailing season ended and there was no longer the same need for the ports. The customs station was closed in 1960, the unloading station was closed in 1971, and the post office was closed in 1975.

Recreation
In the 20th century, Merdø became more and more a holiday and tourist destination. The island gradually depopulated completely, but the houses are still used as summer homes for vacationing families.  Merdø also has a large number of cabins that were built during the 20th century. Merdø has several nice swimming areas with good sandy beaches, and it is a popular destination for people in the Arendal area. There are ferries to and from the car-free island every half hour during the summer season. During the low season and all year round, both ferry companies offer taxi boat services.

345,"Htay Kywe (, ) is a repeatedly-imprisoned Burmese pro-democracy activist who was considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. BBC News describes him as a key member of the 8888 Generation movement.

Background and role in 1988 protests
Htay Kywe was the third son of U Kywe and Mi Mi Lay of Yangon; he went on to study geology at the University of Yangon. In 1988, his second year at the university, he became an early organizer in the widespread protests against military ruler Ne Win. On 16 March, he helped organize what the democracy movement would later name the ""Red Bridge protest,"" during which riot police allegedly killed more than 100 protesters. On 22 March, he and his brother Win Kywe were arrested for their role and detained in Insein Prison until July. These protests culminated in a general strike which began on 8 August, giving the ""8888 Uprising"" its name. Htay Kywe acted as a spokesman for the movement, giving an interview to BBC News.

Following the military coup by Saw Maung's State Law and Order Restoration Council, Htay Kywe was one of the student delegates to meet with the general to seek reconciliation.

Post-election arrests
In May 1990, Burma held its first multi-party elections since 1960, with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning 392 of 492 available seats. However, the military annulled the results and soon arrested a number of opposition figures, among them Htay Kywe, who was arrested at his home in Yangon on July 1991. On December 30, 1991, he received a fifteen-year prison term, and he remained jailed until 2004. After his release, he remained active in the pro-democracy movement, co-founding the 88 Generation Students Group.

In September 2006, he was detained along with fellow 88 Generation Students Group members Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho and Min Zeya, in advance of Burma's 2006 national convention. In January 2007, they were released, without official explanation for either their original arrest or their sudden release.

Role in 2007 anti-government protests and arrest

When rising fuel and commodity prices led to widespread unrest in Yangon in August 2007, the 88 Generation Students Group played a major role in organizing protests. The largest of these rallies drew over one hundred thousand protesters, most notably a number of Buddhist monks, giving the uprising the popular nickname ""The Saffron Revolution"" for the color of their robes.

Following a government crackdown on protestors, members of the 88 Generation Students Group were swiftly arrested. Htay Kywe was among the last to be captured, leading the New York Times to describe him as Burma's ""most-wanted man"". Security forces posted his photograph in hotels, raided homes, and searched buses for him at checkpoints. He was finally arrested on 13 October 2007 when he emerged from hiding to visit his mother, who was suffering from cancer; when she died a month later, he was not allowed to attend her funeral.

Trial and imprisonment
On 11 November 2008, Htay Kywe and thirteen other activists were convicted of four counts of ""illegally using electronic media"" and one count of ""forming an illegal organization"", for a total sentence of 65 years in prison. Other charges against Htay Kwe are still pending. The Burmese government further accused Htay Kywe of being influenced by foreign powers, alleging that a private American group had delivered him $30,000 the previous year.

Htay Kywe is serving his sentence in Buthitaung Prison in Rakhine State. In August 2010, he issued a statement through family members protesting the upcoming 2010 general election, stating that it would be ""insignificant without the participation of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi."" His brother-in-law reported that Htay Kywe had lost weight in confinement and was spending his prison term reading, meditating, and studying economics. He is often kept in solitary confinement.

International response
Htay Kywe's repeated arrests were condemned by numerous human rights organizations. Amnesty International considered him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. Human Rights Watch called for him to be exonerated and freed, as did Front Line.

The US State Department protested Htay Kywe's arrest, and British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declared that ""this Government will not rest until Htay Kywe and other political prisoners like him are free."" United Nations Special Rapporteur Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro also called for the activist's release.

Release
Htay Kywe was released on 13 January 2012 in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners.

College career
Gachkar accepted a football scholarship from the University of Missouri. As a true freshman, he appeared in 14 games, playing mainly on special teams. He made 16 defensive tackles and one forced fumble.

As a sophomore, he recovered from four surgeries in the off-season, where he had a rib removed to alleviate blood clotting issues in his right arm and upper body. He appeared in 14 games as a backup, collecting 28 tackles (one for loss).

As a junior, he started in 13 games at strongside linebacker, posting 80 tackles (second on the team), 3 sacks and 3 fumble recoveries (led the team). He was part of a defense that ranked 26th in the nation against the run (118.62-yard avg.). He had 4 tackles, one tackle, one forced fumble and 2 fumble recoveries against the University of Nebraska. He made 9 tackles against Oklahoma State University. He had 10 tackles against Kansas State University.

As a senior, he was moved to weakside linebacker to replace All-American Sean Weatherspoon. He started in 13 games, finishing with 51 tackles (led the team), 8.5 tackles for loss, one sack and 2 interceptions. He was a part of the number one scoring defense in the nation.

Professional career

San Diego Chargers
Gachkar was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the seventh round (234th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. On July 28, 2011, he was signed to a four-year deal with the Chargers. As a rookie, he posted 15 defensive tackles and 12 special teams tackles (second on the team).

He became a valuable special teams player, while also being a solid reserve linebacker. In 2012, he recorded 13 tackles (2 for loss), one sack and 8 special teams tackles.

He had 8 tackles against the Denver Broncos.

Dallas Cowboys
On March 15, 2015, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys a two-year, $5.5 million contract, reuniting with former Chargers special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia. As a reserve linebacker, he showed the ability to play all three positions and made Jasper Brinkley expendable. He started against the New Orleans Saints and posted 6 tackles. In the eighth game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles, he saw extended time in place of Sean Lee who was out with a concussion, while tallying 4 tackles (one for loss). He played in every game, registering 8 special teams tackles (tied for fourth on the team) and 13 defensive tackles.

On October 17, 2017, Gachkar signed with the Carolina Panthers. He appeared in 6 games and was declared inactive in 4 contests, while making 5 special teams tackles (tied for third on the team). He wasn't re-signed after the season.

Personal life
Gachkar overcame a life-threatening ailment to even be able to play football. In 2007, after his freshman year at Missouri, he was diagnosed with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. He had developed a blood clot because his collarbone and rib cage were too close together to allow proper blood flow through his veins. As a result, he  underwent major surgery to remove one of his ribs, and a second surgery after another clot developed. Gachkar spent more than 20 hours in surgery and nearly a month in the hospital and he lost 30 pounds. The surgeries initially put his football future in doubt, but Gachkar was diligent in his rehabilitation and he made it back for the 2008 season without missing a game.

On March 23, 2013, he married Lauren Nuckolls, a former Missouri Tiger volleyball player and his high school sweetheart.

348,"Pathology is an American death metal band from San Diego, California, formed in 2006 by drummer Dave Astor (previously with The Locust and Cattle Decapitation). The band were signed to Victory Records for an over three-year period, but now are currently signed to Nuclear Blast Records

History 
In 2006, the band released Surgically Hacked (Amputated Vein Records) which was followed by a full-length debut Incisions of Perverse Debauchery (Grindhead Records) and then Age of Onset (Comatose Records, 2009), the album which led to a contract with Victory Records where the acclaimed Legacy of the Ancients was released on July 6, 2010.

The band began extensive touring (with Nile, with Immolation, Vader, Obituary and Deicide, and with Deströyer 666, among others) but in November a horrible van accident derailed the band from continuing. At that point, the original vocalist Matti Way was replaced by Jonathan Huber (formerly of I Declare War). Guitarist Tim Tiszczenko, who at one point departed to be replaced by Kevin Schwartz, returned to form a guitar tandem with the latter. In May 2011, it was announced that Pathology would enter Lambesis Studios that summer with producer Daniel Castleman to begin working on a new full-length expected in Autumn. On August 30, the band was to start the US tour supporting Grave and Blood Red Throne.

On December 18, 2012, it was announced via the band's official site that they have fulfilled their three-album contract with Victory Records and that both original vocalist Matti Way and original guitarist Tim Tiszczenko have returned to the band. It was also announced that they will have a new album out later in 2013 on their new underground label Sevared Records. Vocalist Jonathan Huber left the band in December of that same year because Astor allegedly did not want the band to tour anymore and Huber stated that there was ""no point in being in a non-touring band.""

Pathology released their seventh full-length studio album Lords of Rephaim on September 3, 2013.

After a successful $4,000 Kickstarter campaign, Pathology released their eighth full-length album Throne of Reign on August 5, 2014.

He was admitted at Queens' College, Cambridge, 21 April 1654, graduated B.A. 1658, and on 26 March in the same year was admitted a fellow of the college. His family connections directed him to the profession of medicine, and he graduated M.D. at Cambridge 1668.

He practised in London, residing in Little Britain, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 12 November 1680. In 1684 he married Sarah, daughter of Sir Vincent Corbet, Baronet, at Shrewsbury. She died 6 December 1686. He retired to his paternal estate in Shropshire, and there died at Little Wyrley Hall 21 January 1710. He was buried in the neighbouring church of Brewood, and his death is recorded on his wife's monument in St. Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. He was learned in theology as well as in medicine, and was an admirer of Dr. Seth Ward, bishop of Sarum, whose views on passive obedience he warmly supported. In some manuscript notes on a sermon of Ward's, on the text ""And they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation"", Fowke expresses his contempt of the conduct of the University of Oxford in 1688, saying, ""These great pretenders to loyalty invited ye Prince of Orange. They had no patience when King James bore upon their privileges in Oxford, but exclamed bitterly against ye king and joyned with the wiggs and dissenters to bring in ye Prince of Orange."" Among the Sloane manuscripts in the British Museum there is a private letter of Fowkes.

353,"Barbara Elizabeth Cornelius Price (born October 21, 1949) is an American businesswoman and politician who served as mayor of Fort Worth, Texas through 2021. She was first elected to the nonpartisan office on June 18, 2011. Price previously served 2½ terms as the elected Tarrant County tax assessor-collector, from 2001 to 2011. She is a Republican who describes herself as fiscally conservative, deplores polarization and extremist tendencies in both major parties, and professes a commitment to work for the entire community as an elected local official. 

Having decided to not seek re-election as mayor after five terms and a tenure spanning ten years, Price announced in June 2021 that she will be a candidate for County Judge of Tarrant County in the forthcoming election cycle. 

In Texas, the county judge is the chief executive of the county and typically does not perform judicial duties. Unlike the mayor, the judge is elected in a partisan contest, which will require Price to win nomination in the Republican primary. Although Price enjoys personal popularity, she faces competition from hardline Republicans. She will face off against Tim O’Hare, the former Tarrant County Republican chairman, who has the support of Allen West, the recently departed chair of the Texas GOP.

The general election for Tarrant County Judge will coincide with mid-term elections on  November 8, 2022, with the primary to take place on March 1, 2022.

Early life and education

Price was born Barbara Elizabeth Cornelius in Tarrant, Texas to parents Wayne Clarence Cornelius and Elizabeth Mary Dalton. Price is the youngest of four children. Residing on Tremont Avenue in the Arlington Heights neighborhood of Fort Worth, Price attended South Hi Mount Elementary School and Stripling Junior High School. She graduated from Arlington Heights High School in 1968, where she had been President of her homeroom, as well as President of the Future Homemakers of America. She was also a member of the Allied Youth and Young Citizen's Forum and spent time working as a nurse's assistant. As a high school senior, Price was selected as one of the elite Who's Who and was a finalist in a Daughters of the American Revolution contest. Her first jobs included babysitting and working at her family's used car business, Cornelius Motors, which is located on Fort Worth's northeast side. With aspirations after high school to become a veterinarian, Price earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1972.

Career

Beginning in the late 1980s, Price ran her own car title and licensing company from her father's car business for 17 years, during which she involved herself in title lending reform at the state level and became active in other community affairs such as the FWPD's Bike Officers Citizens Support Club. She had also been the Vice President of the Red Cross. Price served on numerous boards, commissions, and professional associations.

Active in the Republican Party, Price began her first bid for public office and ran for office in 2000 for the position of Tarrant County's Tax Assessor. She was elected. Price has stated she never thought about running for mayor, but began contemplating the position after being approached by several politicos, including Congresswoman Kay Granger, who was the first female mayor of Fort Worth in the early 1990s. 

In 2011, Price decided to run for mayor of Fort Worth, Texas, winning a run-off election against Jim Lane in the non-partisan contest. She succeeded Mike Moncrief. She was elected to a third consecutive term in 2015, running unopposed.

In April 2016, Price announced her support for several measures to change the city charter: the most important included increasing the number of council seats from 8 to 10 (due to the city's northward expansion), increasing the term of office from 2 years to 3 years, raising the pay of the council, and determining how to fill a vacant council seat.

In May 2019, Price defeated Tarrant County Democratic Party Chair Deborah Peoples, who earned 42% of the vote, compared with Price's 56%.

In October 2019, Price denounced the Fort Worth Police Department's shooting of Atatiana Jefferson and announced that she wanted the police chief to conduct a ""complete and thorough investigation."" 

In 2020, Price contracted Covid-19, but recovered, after several scares with the virus throughout the pandemic. On January 6, 2021, Price announced that she would not seek a sixth term.

During her time as mayor, she was known to have a close working relationship with Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings.

Personal life
She has been married to Tom Price, an insurance executive, for more than 40 years. They have three adult children and several grandchildren.

354,"Darlington College of Education was a teacher training college which existed for over one hundred years in the town of Darlington, County Durham in northern England.

The college was founded in 1876 by the British and Foreign School Society at Vane Terrace, Darlington.  Details of the college's physical expansion, student residences and principals can be found on the website of the Darlington Arts Centre which now occupies its former main building. (See External Link) 

For most of its life the college was mainly concerned with the training of nursery school teachers.  A period of rapid expansion in the 1960s saw it grow in size to about 450 students by the early 1970s.  A general training for infant and junior teachers was offered, as well as three specialist courses in biology, mathematics and physical education for secondary teachers.  Academic validation of courses was provided by the University of Durham.

Darlington was one of nearly fifty colleges forced to close down because of an enormous cut-back in planned teacher numbers by central government.  David Hencke's book on these events selects Darlington as one of four case studies and explores the political vulnerability of the college.

The final cohort of students left the college in 1978.

 Quickbus Route 40 (MTA Maryland)
 Local bus Route 20 (MTA Maryland)
 Local bus Route 22 (MTA Maryland)
 Local bus Route 23 (MTA Maryland)

Landmarks
Hebrew Friendship Cemetery, one of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in Maryland, is located entirely within the Baltimore Highlands. The cemetery's original grounds were purchased by the Fells Point Hebrew Friendship Congregation in 1849. In the years since then, the cemetery has expanded until it now stretches from Baltimore Street (south) to Pulaski Highway (north).

Chesapeake Uniform Rental, Inc. operates a commercial laundry service plant, under the trade name of Lord Baltimore Uniform, at 3710 E. Baltimore Street. The plant originally opened in 1946 as Lord Baltimore Laundry, Inc. It became part of Chesapeake Uniform in 1999.

Esskay Meats
Esskay's main meatpacking plant was located in the Baltimore Highlands neighborhood at 3800 E. Baltimore Street until 1993. When the plant was completed in 1920, the company incorporated and began operating as Schluderberg-Kurdle Co., Inc., the result of a merger that year between Schluderberg Meatpacking Company and a meatpacking business owned by Thomas J. Kurdle. Esskay was a trade name for the company's products. Its corporation name was amended to Esskay, Inc. on January 17, 1989.

After it was purchased in 1985 by Smithfield Foods, Inc., Esskay continued operating as a subsidiary of Smithfield. Its Baltimore plant was closed in 1993, because its structure was not strong enough to support the 10-ton ham-boiling machines the company was planning add to its operations. Its departure from Baltimore also involved a dispute over the continued payment of retiree health benefits.

358,"The Ebert test gauges whether a computer-based synthesized voice can tell a joke with sufficient skill to cause people to laugh. It was proposed by film critic Roger Ebert at the 2011 TED conference as a challenge to software developers to have a computerized voice master the inflections, delivery, timing, and intonations of a speaking human. The test is similar to the Turing test proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 as a way to gauge a computer's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior by generating performance indistinguishable from a human being.

Ebert lost his voice after surgery to treat cancer. He employed a Scottish company called CereProc, which custom-tailors text-to-speech software for voiceless customers who record their voices at length before losing them, and mined tapes and DVD commentaries featuring Ebert to create a voice that sounded more like his own voice. He first publicly used the voice they devised for him in his March 2, 2010 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

360,"William FitzHardinge Berkeley, 1st Earl FitzHardinge (26 December 1786 – 10 October 1857), known as The Lord Segrave between 1831 and 1841, was a British landowner and politician.

Background
Berkeley was born at Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London, the eldest son of Frederick Berkeley, 5th Earl of Berkeley, by Mary Cole, daughter of William Cole. He was the brother of Maurice Berkeley, 1st Baron FitzHardinge, Francis Henry FitzHardinge Berkeley, George Charles Grantley Fitzhardinge Berkeley and Craven Berkeley and the nephew of Sir George Cranfield Berkeley.

Dispute over legitimacy
Great uncertainties were raised about whether his parents had two marriage ceremonies, or whether his mother was as with other children she conceived with his father a different/same but unmarried lady. On 16 May 1796 the Earl of Berkeley had married Mary Cole at Lambeth. The Earl then maintained they had married at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, officiated by the Vicar of Berkeley, on 30 March 1785. This ceremony was, however, kept secret until after the Lambeth marriage, with Mary being known as Miss Tudor between the two dates. Shortly after the Lambeth marriage a certificate of the Berkeley ceremony was produced, having been recovered, it was alleged, under very strange circumstances. The couple had had six sons up to the marriage of 1796, including William Berkeley. In 1799, after the Earl announced his earlier marriage/ceremony, William Berkeley (commonly styled Viscount Dursley, the normal courtesy title for the heir apparent to the earldom) obtained leave (permission) to prove his legitimacy before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords, and in 1801 the Earl made a deposition giving full details of the Berkeley marriage.

Claim to barony and earldom of Berkeley
Lord Berkeley died in August 1810, when William Berkeley applied to be summoned to the House of Lords as Earl of Berkeley. In March 1811 the Committee for Privileges decided that the Berkeley marriage of 1786 was ""not then proved"" and that the petitioner's claim was not made out.  William received Berkeley Castle and the other estates by will, and on 2 July, after the adverse decision of the Lords Committee, he claimed a writ of summons as a Baron as Baron by tenure of Berkeley Castle. The claim was fully laid before the Committee for Privileges in 1828 and 1829, but the Lords gave no judgement on the case. The eldest son born after the 1797 Lambeth marriage of the fifth Earl, Thomas Moreton FitzHardinge Berkeley, became on the Earl's death in 1810 de jure 6th Earl of Berkeley — however, he refused to claim his right to the earldom. In 1831 William Berkeley  was raised to the peerage as Baron Segrave, of Berkeley Castle in the County of Gloucester.

Public appointments
Berkeley was returned to parliament as one of two representatives for Gloucestershire in 1810 (succeeding his uncle Sir George Cranfield Berkeley), a seat he only held until 1811. He succeeded his father as Colonel of the Royal South Gloucestershire Light Infantry Militia in 1810 and commanded it until his death. In 1836 he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, a post he retained until his death. In 1841 he was further honoured when he was made Earl FitzHardinge.

Personal life
Berkeley never married.  He had several mistresses, and in 1821 John Waterhouse succeeded in an action for ""criminal conversation"" (adultery) against him, being awarded £1000 damages at Gloucester Assizes over Berkeley's affair with Mrs Waterhouse.  He died at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire, in October 1857, aged 70. The barony of Segrave and earldom of FitzHardinge died with him. The FitzHardinge title was revived in 1861 when his younger brother Maurice Berkeley was created Baron FitzHardinge.

361,"Nelson Harding (October 31, 1879 – December 30, 1944) was an American editorial cartoonist for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. He won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in both 1927 and 1928, and as of 2020 was the only cartoonist so honored in consecutive years. The cartoon that he won the Pulitzer Prize for in 1927 was called ""Toppling The Idol"" of which he depicted the ""passive effect of the League of Nations"" when dealing with the war. He used the images of David and Goliath. The particular cartoon cited in 1928, ""May His Shadow Never Grow Less"", was a tribute drawn at the end of the 1927 calendar year to flier Charles Lindbergh, it was for the flight across the Mexico America border to improve the relations between the two countries.
The Christmas-themed cartoon was published at the very end of 1927 and was eligible for Pulitzer consideration in 1928.

Harding was born in New York City. His work was often politically conservative by the standards of his day. He took a leading role in opposition to what some New Yorkers considered to be a threat from Bolshevism in the late 1910s, during the so-called First Red Scare. His cartoons portrayed political radicals as bomb-throwers and terrorists.

Education
Harding attended Greenwich Academy (now an all girls school) as a child. He also attended The Chase School, the Art Students' League of New York and the New York School of Art for his training in art. While at the Chase school he was instructed by Robert Henri who was a master of his art.

Career
In 1898 Harding served in the Spanish–American War with the U.S. Volunteers, he served 13 years in the National Guard 71st Battalion Company B. In 1901 he was promoted to Sargent under Major J.H. Wells. Nelson Harding started working for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1908 where he became a successful cartoonist.

Pulitzer Prizes

""Toppling the Idol""
For his cartoon that was published on September 19, 1926, Harding won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1927 with his cartoon ""Toppling the Idol."" It depicts a group representing the League of Nations dragging the statue of Mars (mythology) off its pedestal.

""May His Shadow Never Grow Less""
Published on December 15, 1927, the 1927 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning winner depicts the Charles A. Lindbergh flight from New York to Paris in a single-engine plane. The religious symbol on the ground with the words ""Peace on Earth and Goodwill to Men"" was inspired by the approaching Christmas season.

369,"Hosea T. Lockard (June 24, 1920 - December 12, 2011) was an African-American Criminal Court Judge in the U.S. State of Tennessee for Shelby County. He was born in Ripley, Tennessee, and was raised on a farm in the nearby town of Henning by Albert and Lucille Lockard, also of Ripley. He grew up during segregation and attended public schools in Memphis, Tennessee, 50 miles southwest of Ripley because African-Americans were not allowed to attend the all-white public schools in Ripley.

After serving in the U.S. Army in the early 1940s, Lockard returned to school and completed college at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. He then applied to law school at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) but was denied admission because of his race. Lockard attended Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, which had been established by the Missouri General Assembly as a law school for African-Americans.  After graduating in 1950, he returned to Tennessee and was admitted to practice law in 1951.

In 1955, Lockard became president of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP and served in that position until 1958. He headed up their legal committee, and during this time, he was joined by Russell Sugarmon, Vasco and Maxine Smith, Jesse Turner, Billy Kyles, Benjamin Hooks and A.W. Willis in fighting for and achieving success in the desegregation of the Memphis Street Railway Co., public buildings, restaurants and the University of Memphis.

He built a successful law practice and became the first African-American member of a Tennessee governor's cabinet, serving as administrative assistant to Gov. Buford Ellington from 1967 to 1971. He advised President Lyndon B. Johnson on civil rights issues and matters pertaining to race relations.

As a judge, he served on the Shelby County Criminal Court from 1975 to 1994 and remained active in the legal community until physical ailments and a stroke slowed him down.

Lockard was married to Ida Walker Lockard for 49 years. He died in his sleep of natural causes.

History
The facility has its origins in the Helensburgh Hospital which was financed by a legacy from Anne Alexander and which opened as a hospital for both infectious and non-infectious diseases in 1876. A new hospital, designed by William Leiper and intended to deal purely with non-infectious cases, opened on a near-by site in September 1895. It became the Victoria Infirmary to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and an extension providing new physiotherapy, X-ray and out-patient facilities opened in 1951.

The Jeanie Deans Unit, which was built to the south of the infirmary building, received a visit by the Princess Royal in 1998. It was redeveloped as a modern integrated care centre in 2009.

Services
The site comprises the Victoria Infirmary Building, the Jeanie Deans Centre, the Community Base and the Out-Patient Department. The Victoria Infirmary Building is now little used. The Jeanie Deans Centre now provides a base for outreach Mental Health Services including consultants/CPNs and clinical psychology.  In addition, there are out-patient facilities for Chiropody. The former nurses' home has been converted into a base for community staff working within the area including nurse, community paediatric and administrative staff. The Out-Patient Department provides facilities for a number of visiting consultants together with X-ray, physiotherapy and dental departments.

After playing for the Public Schools against Combined Services in 1948, Disbury played for both Combined Services and the RAF whilst on National Service. His performances brought him to the attention of Kent County Cricket Club.

Disbury joined Kent in 1954, starting well for the Second XI before making his first-class cricket debut in the 1954 County Championship against Sussex. An effective opening batsman for the Second XI, he was less successful for the First XI and he ""never managed to bridge the gulf"" between the levels. He played a total of 14 times for Kent in first-class cricket, with his last match coming against Somerset in the 1957 County Championship.

He scored a total of 288 runs but only managed to pass 20 three times, with a high score of 74 not out, his only half century, being scored in three hours  against Leicestershire at Tunbridge Wells in 1956. Disbury took 5 wickets with his medium pace bowling with best figures of 2/76. He left the Kent staff at the end of the 1957 season, although he played a few Second XI matches in 1958 and 1959 as an amateur and won his Second XI cap in 1955.

Later life
Disbury qualified as a chartered accountant and emigrated to the United States in 1960. He married an American woman and settled in Arizona. His sister, Audrey Disbury, played 10 Women's Test matches for England women.

He died in 2016 in Oro Valley, Arizona in the United States at the age of 86.

372,"Nicolai Müller (born 25 September 1987) is a German footballer who plays for Central Coast Mariners in the A League.

Club career

Early career 
Müller began his career with TSV Wernfeld aged 11. In 1998, he joined Eintracht Frankfurt who had just won the 2. Bundesliga. He played for Die Adler until 2003, when he joined SpVgg Greuther Fürth.

Greuther Fürth 
In 2006, Müller moved up to Greuther Fürth II in the Bayernliga. He would play for Fürth's reserves for the next three years until midway through the 2008–09 season, when he was loaned out to 3. Liga side SV Sandhausen, who he helped to an eighth-place finish in the first ever 3. Liga campaign. For the next season, Müller returned to Greuther Fürth. He finally broke into the first team with the Cloverleaves in the 2009–10 season and continued to play for the first team in 2010–11. This would be his last year with Fürth, though they finished fourth, as at the end of the season Müller joined Mainz 05.

Mainz 05 
Müller signed a contract lasting until 2015 with the Bundesliga club. His debut came against Hannover 96 in August as a substitute for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in the last minute. His first start came three games later against Borussia Dortmund and he scored his first Bundesliga goal.

Hamburger SV 
On 6 August 2014, Müller joined Hamburger SV signing a four-year contract. His debut for HSV came on the third matchday against Hannover 96 in the 2–0 loss at the HDI-Arena. After the game, Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka left the club and Josef Zinnbauer took charge for the next match against Bayern Munich, in which Müller started and received his first booking for a 59th-minute foul on Dante.

Müller scored Hamburg's first goal of the 2014–15 season when he equalised against Eintracht Frankfurt on 28 September 2014. HSV eventually lost the game to a Lucas Piazon free-kick in the last minute.

HSV avoided relegation through the relegation play off for the second successive season in Müller's debut year, as he came on as a substitute and scored a 115th-minute winner during the relegation play-off game that took place at the end of the Bundesliga season, against Karlsruher SC. Müller's goal ensured that HSV would stay in the Bundesliga for the next year, keeping their unique status as the only team to have played in the Bundesliga for every year since its formation, as they won 3–2 on aggregate.

On 20 August 2017, the first matchday of the 2017–18 Bundesliga season, Müller got injured while celebrating scoring a goal against FC Augsburg. Medical examination confirmed that the striker had ruptured the ACL in his right knee and would be out for approximately seven months. He returned to the pitch on matchday 33, in a 3–0 defeat away to Eintracht Frankfurt.

Eintracht Frankfurt 
After the 2017–18 season Hamburger SV got relegated from the Bundesliga and Müller joined Eintracht Frankfurt on a free transfer signing a two-year contract until summer 2020. On 30 December 2018, it was announced that Müller would be loaned out to Hannover 96 for the remainder of the 2018–19 season.

Western Sydney Wanderers 
In October 2019, Müller joined Australian club Western Sydney Wanderers as an injury replacement for Radosław Majewski.

Career statistics 

1.Includes German Cup.
2.Includes UEFA Europa League.
3.Includes Relegation playoff.

International career 
On 29 May 2013, Müller made his German international debut in a friendly match against Ecuador in Boca Raton, Florida, entering as a last-minute substitute for Lukas Podolski.

379,"The history of Reading Football Club covers almost 150 years of both success and failure of the football club from Reading, England. The club was established in 1871, making it one of the oldest professional teams in England. Reading joined the Football League in 1920. The Royals competed at the top flight of English football for the first time in the 2006–07 season.

Early years (1871–1941)
Reading Football Club was formed on 25 December 1871 by founder Joseph Edward Sydenham. They were originally nicknamed The Biscuitmen after one of the main trades in the town, Huntley & Palmers biscuits, but changed to the Royals in the 1970s, when the company closed their factory. This history is reflected in the name of the club's unofficial fanzine, Hob Nob Anyone?, named after a popular British biscuit.

The switch to professionalism in 1895 resulted in the need for a bigger ground and, to this end, the club moved again, to the purpose-built Elm Park on 5 September 1896.

In 1913, Reading toured Italy and beat Genoa 4–2 and A.C. Milan 5–0, narrowly lost 2–1 to Casale, before beating Italian champions Pro Vercelli 6–0 and the full Italian national team 2–0, prompting the leading sports newspaper Corriere della Sera to write ""without doubt, Reading FC are the finest foreign team seen in Italy.""  Reading were invited back for another tour the following year, but there is no evidence it took place. It is possible it was cancelled due to the imminence of World War I, which claimed the lives of many Reading F.C. players, including Alan Foster, who put a hat-trick past Milan. Other players lost included amateurs Charles West and Heber Slatter. Attilio Fresia moved to Reading as a result of the tour, becoming the first Italian to play in English football.

Reading were elected to the Third Division of the Football League in 1920, as the league absorbed the first division club of the Southern Football League. The club have spent the majority of the time since then in the third and fourth tiers of the league, with occasional flirtations with the second tier.

Reading's best performance in the FA Cup came in 1926–27 when they lost to eventual winners Cardiff City at Molineux in Wolverhampton in the semi-final. The attendance at the 1–0 victory over Brentford in the fifth round set a new attendance record for Elm Park, at 33,042 people. This remains the highest attendance at a Reading home match.

Reading were promoted to the Second Division, following a Third Division South title win in 1926; the Royals were relegated back to the third tier in May 1931. The club defeated Bristol City to win the Southern Section Cup in 1938, and won the London War Cup in 1941 by defeating Brentford 3–2 in the final at Stamford Bridge.

Post-war years (1945–1990)

The club remained in Division Three after the war, but finished in second place in their division in 1948–49 and 1951–52. Their 10–2 win over Crystal Palace in September 1946 remains the club's scoring record.

Reading were relegated to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in the 1971–72 season. A return to the Third Division was achieved, following a third-placed finish in 1975–76, but the club suffered immediate relegation. The 1978–79 season saw Reading win the Fourth Division to win promotion back to the Third Division.

Relegation was suffered in 1982–83. Towards the end of that season, Oxford United chairman Robert Maxwell announced that he had completed a deal to merge Oxford and Reading into a single club – Thames Valley Royals. Maxwell claimed that both clubs were on the verge of bankruptcy and having a united team was required for the Thames Valley region to retain a Football League club. The proposed amalgamation was prevented by the actions of Roy Tranter, a Reading director, and Roger Smee, a former Reading player. Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the three board members that supported the merger plan. Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983. The supporters of the plan allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the Reading board in May 1983. At an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in July, Smee took over the club to end the amalgamation plans.

Following the collapse of the merger plan, Reading were promoted back to the Third Division at the end of the 1983–84 season. This remains the last time the football club has competed at this level of English football. Reading won the league in the 1985–86 season under the management of Ian Branfoot, following a run of thirteen successive wins at the start of the season, earning promotion to the Second Division. This was the first time in fifty-five years that the club had played at this level.

The club reached their first major cup final in the 1987–88 season, when they won the Simod Cup. They beat four top flight sides en route to the final. The club's first Wembley appearance saw the club victorious over First Division Luton Town, with a 4–1 victory. Later in the season, the club were relegated back to the third tier. Branfoot left his job as manager in October 1989, having failed to get the Royals back into the Second Division. His successor, Ian Porterfield, lasted just 18 months before further failures cost him his job.

New era (1990–1998)
The appointment of Mark McGhee as player-manager, shortly after the takeover by John Madejski, in June 1991 saw Reading move forward.

They were crowned champions of the new Division Two in 1994, seeing the club promoted to the second tier. When McGhee moved to Leicester City halfway through the following season, Reading were in contention for a second successive promotion. 35-year-old striker Jimmy Quinn was put in charge of the first team alongside midfielder Mick Gooding and guided Reading to runners-up in the final Division One table – only to be denied automatic promotion because of the streamlining of the Premier League, from twenty-two teams to twenty. Reading had eased past Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals and looked to have booked their place in the Premier League after building up a 2–0 lead over Bolton Wanderers by half time in the play-off final. Two late goals from Bolton forced extra time and the match ended 4–3 to Bolton. Quinn and Gooding's contracts were not renewed two years later after Reading had slid into the bottom half of Division One.

Their successor, Terry Bullivant, lasted less than one season before being sacked in March 1998. The Royals finished that season bottom of Division One, slipping back into Division Two in their final season at Elm Park.

Onwards and upwards (1998–2008)
Reading moved into the new 24,200 all-seater Madejski Stadium, named after chairman John Madejski, in August 1998. The club won their first match at the ground, beating Luton Town 3–0.

Tommy Burns had taken over from Terry Bullivant but lasted just 18 months before being sacked in September 1999, after a poor start to the season after the club's failure to win promotion the previous season. He was replaced by former reserve team manager Alan Pardew.

Pardew guided Reading to a third-place finish in the 2000–01 season, where the club were beaten in the play-off final by Walsall 3–2 after extra time. Later on in 2001, Reading became the first football club to register their fans as an official member of their squad, giving the ""player"" registered with squad number 13 as 'Reading Fans'.

Reading returned to Division One for the 2002–03 season after finishing runners-up in Division Two. A final day draw away at promotion rivals Brentford saw the club promoted. The following season they finished fourth in Division One and qualified for the play-offs, where they lost in the semi-final to eventual winners Wolverhampton Wanderers. Pardew acrimoniously moved to West Ham United the following October and being replaced by Brighton & Hove Albion manager Steve Coppell. Coppell took the Royals to seventh in his first full season with the club, missing out on a place in the play-offs by three points.

Reading won the 2005–06 Championship with a league record 106 points, scoring 99 goals and losing only twice in league. Promotion to the Premiership was assured on 25 March 2006, with a 1–1 draw away at Leicester City. The following Saturday, the club secured the title with a 5–0 thumping of Derby County.

The 2006–07 season saw Reading make their first appearance in the top flight of English football. Striker Dave Kitson became the first player to score for Reading in the top flight, as the Royals came from 2–0 to beat Middlesbrough 3–2 in their first game in the Premiership. The Royals defied pre-season predictions of relegation to finish the season in eighth place with 55 points, missing out on UEFA Cup football by a single point; Reading turned down the chance to play in the UEFA Intertoto Cup.

In the run up to their second season in the Premier League, Reading were invited to take part in the 2007 Peace Cup in South Korea, playing Argentine giants River Plate, French champions Lyon and Japanese side Shimizu S-Pulse. The Royals failed to qualify for the final on goal difference. This second season was less successful and Reading were relegated back to the Championship following a loss of form in the second half of the season. Despite winning 4–0 away at fellow strugglers Derby County on the last day of the season, Fulham's 1–0 at Portsmouth was enough to see the club fall out of the top flight.

Recent seasons (2008–present)
Reading started the 2008–09 season with a 15 match unbeaten home run until losing to Southampton. In the second half of the season, they struggled to regain the form and slipped down the table before recovering to finish fourth and qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Burnley in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, being replaced by former academy manager Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009, following a poor start to the season which saw the Royals in a relegation battle.

Brian McDermott was made caretaker manager the same day. He was given the job on a full-time basis, following a surprise 2–1 extra time win over Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup. Reading reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time since the 1927 cup-run, losing 4–2 to Aston Villa at the Madejski Stadium. In the following season, Reading beat West Bromwich Albion, Stevenage and Everton to reach the quarter-final of the competition for the second successive season, where they lost 1–0 to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium. In the league, Reading finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's play-offs. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals they lost 4–2 to Swansea City in the final at Wembley Stadium.

Reading started the 2011–12 season by selling captain Matt Mills and player of the season Shane Long. Early results were not favourable and the club sat second-bottom of the table after six games. However, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, combined with the signings of Adam Le Fondre, Kaspars Gorkšs and Jason Roberts, ensured promotion to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against Nottingham Forest. In their next match on 21 April 2012, Reading secured the Championship title with a game to spare after 2–2 draw with Crystal Palace when second-placed Southampton failed to beat Middlesbrough, losing 2–1.

On 21 January 2012, it was announced that John Madejski planned to sell 51% of the club to Thames Sport Investments led by Russian-born Anton Zingarevich which was eventually completed on 29 May 2012.

On 30 October 2012, Reading created an unwanted record in the last 16 of the League Cup. At home to Arsenal, they took a 4–0 lead after 37 minutes, but Arsenal drew level at 4–4 in stoppage time to take the match into extra time, where Reading lost 7–5. Reading became the first club in the League or FA Cup to have scored five goals in a match and to have still lost. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Reading were relegated back to the Championship following a 0–0 draw with relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers.

On 17 March 2015, Reading beat Bradford City 3–0 at the Madjeski Stadium in an FA Cup quarter-final replay to advance to the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1927. The Royals were defeated by Premier League Arsenal 2–1, after extra time, to end the club's run in the competition. The club reached the quarter-finals in the next season, losing to Crystal Palace after two late goals by the Premier League outfit.

In the 2016–17, Reading reached the play-offs, following a third place league finish, under new manager Jaap Stam. The Royals narrowly beat Fulham 2-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to advance to the final. Following a 0–0 draw at Wembley on 29 May 2017, Huddersfield Town defeated Reading 4–3 on penalties to deny the club a return to the Premier League.

381,"Sir Alec Edward Reed, CBE, FCMA, FCIPD (born 16 February 1934) is the founder of Reed Executive Ltd, one of the UK's largest private businesses.  Knighted for services to business and charity in 2011, Reed is a high-profile charity donor and organiser. His various charitable initiatives have given away over £186m, mostly in support of women, addiction, overseas development, education and the arts. Reed has founded seven charities, several companies, two schools and is the author of four business books.  His current job title at Reed is Founder at Large.

Early life
Reed was born in 1934 in Hounslow, Middlesex. His father Leonard was a lithographic artist for the UK's Ministry of Information during WWII, supervising the production of a number of government information posters, including the original version of the Ministry's ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" poster. Reed's mother Nancy was a housewife and former employee of the Prudential Insurance firm. In his autobiography, Reed writes that his earliest memory is listening with his family to Neville Chamberlain's 1939 speech declaring war on Germany, a speech that so alarmed his parents that they fled London in a neighbour's car the same day, thinking invasion imminent, only to return ""...before teatime"" after concluding that nowhere in the country would be safe.

A child of The Blitz, Reed has described his childhood as generally ""secure"", though he has also said that much of his early motivation came from feeling overshadowed by his older brother. Along with a milkround, Reed's first business venture was started alongside his brother while both were still children: the pair made and sold toy soldiers forged from lead that had been salvaged from local bombed-out houses.

Reed attended Drayton Manor Grammar School. At the end of his first year his school report said: ""Conduct very unsatisfactory. He is lazy, inattentive and exerts himself to prevent his neighbours from working. He could do much better if he were more ambitious"". Reed failed his 11-Plus exam; he left school aged 16 to work for a motor vehicle exporter in London's Fenchurch Street, having also failed to get the grades to enter agricultural college and pursue his ambition of becoming a farmer. Reed's mother encouraged him to study a Chartered Secretary's course in the evenings during his day job at the exporters.

He was called up to National Service in 1952. He tried for a commission with the Royal Engineers but was rejected after his Brigadier deemed him to be a ""...muddled thinker"". Reed left the army in 1954 to work as a trainee accountant for Gillette in Osterley, having passed his Chartered Secretary qualification the year before, at the third attempt.

Keen to be self-employed, Reed pursued a number of sideline businesses while still at Gillette, including making his own brand of aftershave that he brewed in his mother's kitchen and sold door-to-door. Reed also began working evenings and weekends in an estate agency in Hounslow, again while still at Gillette. The agency’s premises was split into two businesses, with one side selling property and the other side selling carpets. Noticing that the carpet business was struggling, Reed approached the owner (who was the father of Reed's then-girlfriend) and offered to rent the carpet portion of the premises for his fledgling employment agency, funding the launch with £75 taken from his Gillette pension fund. On 7 May 1960, the 26-year-old Reed opened the first branch of Reed Employment. It went on to become one of Britain's largest privately owned businesses, with 441 business units in 163 locations worldwide, employing over 3,000 people.

Career at Reed
Reed has held the positions of Chief Executive, Executive Chairman, non-executive Chairman and Founder at Large during his career at the Reed group of companies.  In 1997 he stepped down as Chief Executive to become Chairman, handing control of the company to his son James; to mark the handover, Reed presented his son with a conductor's baton in a glass case. Reed became non-executive chairman in 2000 and Founder at Large in 2004, a position he still holds and which he assumed after his son James succeeded him as chairman in the same year.

Reed remains a significant minority shareholder, through both his personal holding and that of the Reed Foundation, to which he donated 18% of all shares in the company.

Other business ventures 
In 1970, Reed founded Inter-Company Comparisons, now ICC PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of a Swedish business group. In 1974, he also founded Medicare Limited, a 50-branch drug store with 500 employees, now part of Superdrug. Reed would later write that he started Medicare simply to smooth out the cash flow performance of his then-publicly quoted companies. He is a noted critic of the administrative burden of running public companies, and has compared his experience of running the Reed group as a public company to being an ""...unpaid greyhound on a racetrack called the stock market"". He would later blame the stress of running Medicare for his diagnosis of colon cancer; the business was sold as part of his recuperation, at his wife's insistence.

From 1985 to 1989 Reed was the honorary chairman and chief exec of Andrews and Partners Estate Agency. He took the business from a loss of £297,000 in 1985 to profits of just over £1m in 1986. The profits were used to buy out the existing shareholders and transfer ownership to three Christian charities. He writes in his autobiography that ""Most of the non-executive directors were also devout Christians who prayed before every meeting. Despite this, I found them extremely difficult to deal with in subsequent negotiations...that episode may have been the beginning of my disillusionment with Christianity"".

Philanthropy
Reed has described encouraging philanthropy as his “…main mission now"". He is the founder of seven charities, including Womankind Worldwide, Ethiopiaid, Reed Restart at Holloway Prison, Women at Risk, and the Alec Reed Academy. In 1985, he established The Reed Foundation, a charitable foundation that provides much of the seed funding for his charity work. In 2007 he launched TheBigGive.co.uk, now one of the UK's foremost charitable giving sites.

The Reed Foundation
The Reed Foundation is the main vehicle for Reed’s philanthropic activities. It was founded in 1985 with Reed's £5m entire personal proceeds from the £20m sale of Medicare. The Foundation owns 18% of Reed Group, hence Reed’s remark that the firm’s employees ""work one day a week for charity"". As of 2012 it reported total funds of £13.91m. Reed is one of four Foundation trustees, along with his three children.

The Foundation has financed numerous charitable initiatives, including:

The Big Give

Founded in 2007, TheBigGive.org.uk is a non-profit, charitable website which enables donors to find and support charity projects in their field of interest. Reed has referred to it as “…a Wikipedia for big givers"" and ""his biggest success"". It reports raising in excess of £186m for charities and supporting 9500 ongoing charity projects. The site now hosts £1.3bn worth of projects in need of funding.

The Big Give inverts the traditional model of charity funding in which donors are contacted by charities, to a model in which donors effectively ""compare and shop"" for charity projects, and then have their donations matched by other donors. Reed founded the site in response to receiving an unmanageable number of appeals from charities seeking donations from high-profile philanthropists. The project was designed to encourage wealthy philanthropists potentially seeking to make donations between £100,000 and £10m. Having attracted few donors at that level, Reed switched to a match funding model, in which he put up £1m and requested other donors to match him; reportedly the site’s users matched Reed’s £1m within 45 minutes of it going live. The site now makes use of ""challenge matching"", in which donors effectively compete to be the first to kickstart a given charity project.

In addition to projects uploaded by charities, the site also runs emergency appeals (such as for victims of the 2014 Philippines hurricane and the 2013 Syrian refugee crisis, and an annual Christmas Challenge), in which Reed’s funds (and those of external foundations) are joined with pledges from charities' own major donors, in order to double online donations made by the public. The 2020 Christmas Challenge raised £20m for 700+ charities.

The Big Give also helps charities to find trustees and runs educational programmes in schools in order to raise children’s awareness of philanthropic giving. The organisation's Board of Philanthropists include Lord Bell, Lord Gavron CBE, Lord Haskins, Sir Adrian Cadbury, Sir Charles Dunstone, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho, Jon Snow and Michael Spencer

Ethiopiaid

Ethiopiaid works with local community partners in Ethiopia to alleviate poverty, support the elderly, empower women and girls, help children with disabilities and increase access to health care and education. Reed founded the charity with a £1m donation in 1989, having visited the Ethiopian capital in 1987 on a fact-finding tour organised and accompanied by Jembra Teferra, a relative of Haile Selassie and wife of a former mayor of the city. Reed had initially planned on promoting entrepreneurship in the area, but upon arrival was struck by Addis Ababa’s poor public sanitation, especially in the ""kebeles"" (poor urban neighbourhoods). Reed subsequently underwrote a two-year project to develop the kebeles, and arranged pledges for additional financial assistance from Water Aid, Help the Aged and Band Aid. Ethiopiaid has gone on to donate £28m in funding and match-funding.  The charity now partners with around 14 local Ethiopian organisations, providing around £2m in donations.

One of Ethiopiaid's best-known and longest-standing partners is the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, which helps to treat Ethiopian women marginalised by the social and medical complications arising from post-birth fistula. Ethiopiaid also funds reconstructive operations for sufferers of facial disfiguration caused by noma (a facially disfiguring disease caused by malnutrition and poor sanitation), animal bites and tumours.

Womankind Worldwide
As with Ethiopiaid, Womankind Worldwide was set up with a £1m donation from Reed in 1989. The charity supports women suffering from abuse, neglect and illness; it also educates against female circumcision and child marriage. Patrons include Kate Adie, Sandi Toksvig and Lady Helena Kennedy QC. In 2006 WomanKind Worldwide was merged with Women at Risk, a UK charity founded by Reed in 1997 which works in support of women suffering physical and mental abuse. Women at Risk generated over £1million for beneficiaries, including female survivors of acid attacks. the charity work with more than 40 partner organisations in 15 countries and claims to have reached millions of women and their families worldwide.

Reed Restart
Founded in HMP Holloway in 1993, Reed Restart was a not-for-profit charity dedicated the rehabilitation and assistance of women prisoners, helping them to become more employable on release. The pilot scheme at HMP Holloway was extended to provincial gaols, including Eastwood Park Women’s Prison.

The Alec Reed Academy
This 4-18 coeducational establishment in Northolt, England was one of the first academies to be created under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. It is composed of the former Compton High School and Northholt Primary School. Both areas are close to Reed’s childhood home in Hounslow, and to his former school, Drayton Manor Grammar. Reed’s involvement with the Academy began in November 2001, when he sponsored Compton High School.

In 2012 the West London Academy was renamed The Alec Reed Academy, in honour of its sponsor. The school has a sports and enterprise specialism. Its catchment area has a high percentage of Indian, Pakistani and Polish families; 52% of pupils do not speak English as a first language. 80% of its pupils achieve Level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths.

A 2010 Ofsted inspection saw the school rated as ""Good""; Ofsted’s 2014 inspection, which was marked under Oftsed’s revised scoring regime, saw the school listed as ""requiring improvement"". The 2014 report noted that “…senior managers and leaders have accurately identified the areas of the academy requiring further improvement. Their actions are beginning to have an impact on improving teaching and raising standards""

Reed has spoken of the ""tremendous freedom"" he was given to shape the Academy’s approach, noting that he decided the school’s aims and ethos, chose its headmaster and commissioned the design of its buildings, from Foster & Partners. Reed contributed £2m of the £40m required to launch the Academy. He has also described his involvement as “…an interesting lesson in what happens when private-sector culture meets state-funded culture"". He writes of incurring criticism for his ideas on education, notably his view that the school did not need a significant library in the internet age, nor should it teach foreign languages, owing to the multilingual composition of the school's intake and the primacy of the English language in global business.

Other philanthropic projects 
Reed is the founder of a number of not-for-profit initiatives prior to the Reed Foundation, including the Reed Business School and Addicts Rehabilitation:

Reed Business School

Reed Business School is a not-for-profit residential accountancy college specialising in qualifications such as ACCA, CIMA, ICAEW and CII. The school is based in Reed’s former home, a 15th Century Jacobean manor house in Little Compton, England. The house was purchased with the proceeds of the Reed Group’s stockmarket flotation in 1971, after which Reed donated the house to the Reed Charity. It opened in 1972 as The Reed College of Accountancy, changing its name to Reed Business School after the formation of the Reed Educational Trust in 1980. The school’s trading profits are donated to the Trust and distributed to numerous educational charities.

Addicts Rehabilitation
Reed’s first charity was set up in the 1970s to help the recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts. In a 2011 interview with CIMAGlobal.com, Reed said

""About ten years after we started Reed, the company had become big enough to be made public. I was based in Bond Street and at about that time the Observer newspaper ran a series of articles about people who were having difficult lives. They invited potential volunteers to contact charity organisations, and because I was in Bond Street, I went to work with a drug addiction charity in Covent Garden. Then people began to find out that I was an employment agent and they were all after me to help them get jobs. A lot of them weren't job ready, though, so we started an employment agency for drug addicts [ARC – Addicts Rehabilitation Charity]. Our best support came from small and medium sized companies, where the manager really owned the company and could make the decision – 'yes, I can give this guy a chance.' The big companies were more bureaucratic and weren't able to do that so readily""

In the 1970s Reed bought Keveral Farm in Cornwall where addicts could spend time in recovery. From 1989 to 1992, Reed served on Oxfam's fundraising committee.
Reed described his approach to philanthropy in a 2013 interview with Coutts:

""I believe it’s better for donors to separate the decision about how much money to spend on charitable giving, from the act of giving to charity. By deciding how much you want to give away and ring-fencing it in a foundation, you can elevate the satisfaction you get from giving and make it easier to make the gift. Once you’ve done that, you can continue your research and decide which good causes you wish to support. I call this 'Disneyland Giving': theme park visitors pay once at the gate and are then free to enjoy the rides. I'm still enjoying giving away money I 'spent' on charity 20 years ago.""

Reed has also personally supported a range of smaller UK charities, such as  through which he has supported charities such as The Passage (homelessness) and The Branch Trust (deprived famillies). 

Reed is currently serving as an Enterprise Fellow for The Prince's Trust.

 Recruitment International's Hall of Fame, inducted 2011.

Arts patronage
Reed credits his wife Adrianne as being responsible for his interest in the arts. He is a ballet enthusiast and a noted donor to the Royal Ballet. He also reports donating £100,000 to the Royal Opera House. Reed also invested in noted English choreographer Matthew Bourne's original ballets ""Dorian Gray"" and ""Cinderella,"" with profits on the former production enabling a large investment in the latter. Bourne's ""Cinderella"" is notable for setting the classic story during World War II and transforming the prince of the traditional fairy tale into an injured RAF pilot. The ballet played to full houses at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Reed has described Bourne as ""a creative genius"". In his autobiography Reed expresses interest in moving The Royal Ballet from its current home at the Royal Opera House to the London Coliseum, though he calls this ambition ""probably a pipe dream"".

Reed is an amateur painter, with a focus on portraits. He wrote that painting ""...particularly helped me get through chemotherapy after my second run-in with cancer"". He studied with portrait painter Ken Payne and at the Heatherley School of Fine Art. Reed won a national prize for those over sixty years old for his self-portrait Nice Hat, in which he is portrayed wearing a trilby.

Teaching
Reed became a member of the governing council of Royal Holloway, University of London, in 1979, subsequently becoming the chairman of the college's finance committee. After the formation of the Royal Holloway School of Management in 1990, Reed recruited high-profile guest speakers and donated to the library. He also taught an interactive entrepreneurship course for undergraduates at the school called LIES (Leadership, Innovation and Enterprise Studies). Reed made his students turn up on time ""...to introduce them to the basics of business life""; latecomers were fined £1, paid into a fund which purchased confectionery for the class.

In 1999 Reed was asked by Tony Blair to investigate a decline in teacher training enrollment.

Publications
Reed is the author of several books, including:
 Returning to Work (1989), published by Kogan Page: 
 Innovation in Human Resource Management (2001), published by CIPD: 
 Capitalism is Dead: Peoplism Rules (2002), published by McGraw-Hill: 
 I Love Mondays – Autobiography (2012), published by Profile Books;

Personal life
Reed is married with three children and 11 grandchildren. He and his wife live in a two-bedroom house in Kensington and a converted cottage in Little Compton, Warwickshire.  Debretts list his interests as family, portrait painting, theatre, cinema, tennis, riding, ballet and bridge. He has a lifelong interest in farming and equestrianism, having joined the Young Farmers aged 14. In 2009 he purchased at auction nine lots of land comprising 1600 acres of the estate of Kiddington Hall in the Cotswolds, Oxfordshire; Reed has written of plans to turn the land into a residential equestrian estate.

Reed has said that his early charity work was informed by his conversion to Christianity in his 20s. He is now an atheist and a member of Humanists UK. The Reed Foundation does not fund religious organisations.

He has twice recovered from cancer, after receiving a diagnosis of colon cancer in 1986 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. The latter left a significant scar on his forehead, which he refers to as his ""Mail On Sunday headline"", after being in dispute with the newspaper at the time of his diagnosis.

When asked how he would like to be remembered, Reed said:

""I hope people will remember me as both entrepreneurial and lucky - someone who laughed a lot and attempted to improve the lives of others. I do not just mean the poor in Africa...I also mean those rich people suffering from financial obesity. I hope I have been able to direct their giving in a more fulfilling way and to introduce them to charities with which they feel a strong bond but which they might never have encountered were it not for The Big Give... Above all, I hope they will think of me as an ideas man.""

382,"Brigitte Kronauer (29 December 1940 – 22 July 2019) was a German writer who lived in Hamburg. Her novels, written in the tradition of Jean Paul with artful writing and an ironic undertone, were awarded several prizes, including in 2005 the Georg Büchner Prize, in 2011 the Jean-Paul-Preis and in 2017 the Thomas Mann Prize.

Life 
Kronauer was born in Essen, and grew up with her mother. She studied pedagogy and worked as a teacher in Aachen and Göttingen. She moved to Hamburg in the mid-1970s, where she began her literary work. Her first novel appeared in 1980, Frau Mühlenbeck im Gehäus, published by , which also published all her following works. The novel has autobiographic elements. Its language was unusual in the literature after World War II, with sentences constructed with acrobatic audacity (""von akrobatischer Gewagtheit""). Kronauer named Jean Paul as influential for her work. As in his writing, Kronauer's sentences often contain double-meanings and ironic allusions.

She wrote successful novels such as Berittener Bogenschütze (1986), Teufelsbrück (2000), Verlangen nach Musik und Gebirge (2004), Errötende Mörder (2007), Zwei schwarze Jäger (2009), Gewäsch und Gewimmel (2013) and Der Scheik von Aachen (2016). Her novel Das Schöne, Schäbige, Schwankende is scheduled to appear in August 2019. It is focused on a woman writer, full of self-irony.

In 2005, she was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize for her literary oeuvre. Among other awards, she received the Jean-Paul-Preis in 2011, and the Thomas Mann Prize in 2017.

Kronauer died on 22 July 2019 in Hamburg, after a long illness.

Legacy 
Kronauer's colleague Martin Mosebach, who delivered the laudatory speech when she received the Thomas Mann Prize, said in an interview by Deutschlandfunk on 24 July 2019 that he regards her as writing in the tradition of Jean Paul in a noble way, mentioning aspects such a sublime artistry (""kunstvoll sublim"") and a tender humour with a floating, ironic, delicate undertone (""schwebender, ironischer, zarter Unterton""). He described her as a person open to visual impressions, describing a character's emotions by noting how they are reflected in mimics, and great nature scenes, realising how nature ""arches over the little odd human being"" (""Die Natur wölbt sich über das kleine kauzige Menschenwesen""), again similar to Jean Paul. He described her as a person with a penetrating mind, a perfect careful control of expression, always trying hard to find the right word, and of great kindliness (""... eben diese einzigartige Gegenwart eines durchdringenden Verstandes, einer vollkommenen, sehr, sehr sorgfältigen Kontrolliertheit ihres Ausdrucks, ein ungeheures Bemühen, immer das genau richtige Wort zu finden – und eine große Liebenswürdigkeit""). 

The FAZ called her one of the greatest post-World War II women writers in German.

When she received the Jean-Paul-Preis of Bavaria, her writing was described by the jury: ""The brilliance of her style makes her an exceptional phenomenon in contemporary German literature"" (""Die Brillanz ihres Stils macht sie zu einer Ausnahmeerscheinung in der deutschen Gegenwartsliteratur""), with characteristics such as ""inventiveness, humanity and a sense of humour that accompanies the often idiosyncratic characters of her books with love, and never betrays them"" (""Erfindungskraft, Humanität und ein Humor, der die oft eigenwilligen Figuren ihrer Bücher mit Liebe begleitet und niemals verrät""), while also considered the 'grand master of spite"" (""Großmeisterin der Boshaftigkeit"").

Kronauer's novels, published by Klett-Cotta in Stuttgart and held by the German National Library, include:
 Frau Mühlenbeck im Gehäus, 1980, ; dtv, München 1984,

383,"Socially Useful Productive Work (SUPW) is a ""purposive productive work and services related to the needs of the child and the community, which will be proved meaningful to the learner. Such work must not be performed mechanically but must include planning, analysis and detailed preparation, at every stage so that it is educational in essence. Adoption of improved tools and materials, where available and the adoption of modern techniques will lead to an appreciation of the needs of a progressive society based on technology."" Students learn to work as a team and to work with skill and deftness. It was introduced in 1978, by the Ministry of Education to promote Gandhian values and educational ideas of Mahatma Gandhi.

It remains an ancillary, but mandatory part of course curriculum in schools affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts two examinations in India: the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and the Indian School Certificate (ISC). It is taught in some Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools, which includes Kendriya Vidyalaya and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya schools. 
 
In addition to developing individual skills, SUPW aims to help develop among the students the habit to work as a community, encourage community thinking, increase awareness of scientific advancements and develop a scientific outlook. The training acquired in the classroom is expected to help students to solve day-to-day problems of the community.

In some schools of India game subjects like Yoga, Cricket, swimming, chess, table tennis, basketball, athletes, football, dance, music are also a choice. In some schools SUPW period start from 8th to 12th class.

History

Recommending education through craft, Mahatma Gandhi said, ""The core of my suggestion is that handicrafts are taught not merely for production work but for developing intellect of the pupils"". This idea was taken forward by the Kothari Commission (1964–66), which suggested introduction of 'work experience' in education. Subsequently, after the recommendations of  'Ishwarbhai Patel Committee' (July, 1977), which first coined the term 'Socially Useful Productive Work' or SUPW, the subject was first introduced to the school curriculum in 1978, by Ministry of Education, Government of India.

Crafts and Hobbies
As per the ""Program of Action of the National Policy on Education of 1986"", which emphasizes the promotion of culture and creativity in school children, SUPW curriculum may also include, Pottery, Clay Modeling, Papier-mâché, Mask Making, Tie & Dye, Rangoli, Wall decoration, Cane work, Bamboo work, Book binding, Paper toys, etc.

387,"Dominik Koll (born December 24, 1984) is an Austrian former swimmer, who specialized in freestyle events. He is a two-time Olympian, a 41-time national titleholder, and a 5-time long and short course Austrian record holder. Koll is a member of the swimming team for SK VÖEST Linz. He won a bronze medal, as a member of the Austrian swimming team, at the 2008 European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Koll is one of few LGBT Olympians to come out as gay.

Swimming career
Koll made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, competing in the men's 200 m freestyle. Koll cruised to fourth place in his heat and twenty-fifth overall by 0.53 of a second behind Latvia's Romāns Miloslavskis in 1:51.36.

Four years after competing in his first Olympics, Koll qualified for his second Austrian team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. As a 23-year old, he swam a FINA A-cut time of 1:48.21 at the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Koll set a new Austrian mark in the 200 m freestyle and recorded the sixteenth fastest time of 1:47.81 on the second night of preliminaries to secure the final spot in the semifinals. The following morning, Koll failed to qualify for the final, as he finished his semifinal run with a fourth-slowest time of 1:47.87, just 0.06 of a second off his record from the preliminaries.

Two days later, Koll swam the start-off leg of the men's 4×200 m freestyle relay, recording his individual-split time of 1:47.72. Koll and his teammates David Brandl, Markus Rogan, and Florian Janistyn finished the second heat in fifth place and ninth overall, for another national record-breaking time of 7:11.45.

Shortly after the Olympics, Koll set another national record in the 400 m freestyle at the 2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships, with a time of 3:39.82. The following year, he posted his fifth-career Austrian record time of 1:43.90 by finishing eighth in the preliminary heats of the men's 200 m freestyle at the European Short Course Swimming Championships in Istanbul, Turkey.

Koll is a current member of the swimming team for Columbia Lions, and a film and economics major at Columbia University in New York, New York.

389,"The Tripoli railway station is located near El-Mina, Tripoli, Lebanon. It began operating in 1911 and was connected to the Syrian city, Homs, with a single track. It formed the terminus of the Orient Express line in the twenties, thirties and forties of the last century. Tripoli station was connected to the central station of Beirut (Mar Mikael) in 1945.

Overview
During World War I, the Ottomans, and for military reasons, damaged the Tripoli/Homs line. Ruined, the station was nationalized in 1920 at the time of the French mandate in Lebanon and Syria. In 1943, after independence, the station became the property of the Lebanese state.

In 1975, the station was abandoned and now contains a number of multipurpose buildings. These buildings were severely damaged during the civil war (1975–1991). A series of ancient multi-purpose wagons, two German G7 class locomotives made in 1895, and four German G8 locomotives, made in 1901 and 1906 remain on the site. The traces of war are visible on the vehicles.
In June 2011, the station reopened its doors to visitors for two days only.

390,"NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni (abbreviated to NML Cyg or V1489 Cyg) is a red hypergiant or red supergiant (RSG) in the constellation Cygnus. It is one of the largest stars currently known by radius, and is also one of the most luminous and massive cool hypergiants, as well as one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way.

The distance of NML Cygni from Earth is estimated to be around 1.6 kpc, about . It is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, one of the closest massive associations to the Sun, spanning nearly 2° on the sky or ∼ in radius at the distance of .

The radius of NML Cyg is uncertain but calculated to be between 1,183 and 2,770 times that of the Sun (). If placed at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the orbit of Jupiter or Saturn.

Observational history

NML Cygni was discovered in 1965 by American astronomers Neugebauer, Martz, and Leighton who described two extremely red luminous stars, their colour being consistent with a black body temperature of .  The name NML comes from the names of these three discoverers.  The second star was briefly referred to as NML Tauri but is now known as IK Tauri, an M9 Mira variable.  NML Cygni has since also been given the designation V1489 Cygni on account of the small semi-regular brightness variations, but is still most commonly referred to as NML Cygni.  Its composition began to be revealed with the discovery of OH masers (1612 MHz) in 1968.  , , , , , , , and  molecules have also been detected.

Physical characteristics

NML Cygni is an extremely large and luminous cool supergiant with parameters similar to that of another notable but more extreme cool hypergiant star, VY Canis Majoris, and is also known as a heavily mass-losing OH/IR supergiant. It is also a semiregular variable star with a period of either 1,280 or 940 days. It occupies the upper-right hand corner of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram although most of the properties of the star depend directly on its distance.

The bolometric luminosity (Lbol) for NML Cygni was originally calculated to be  at an assumed distance of  and the radius was calculated to be  based on an  angular diameter and distance. A 2006 study, similar to those conducted on VY Canis Majoris, suggests that NML Cygni is a normal red supergiant with consequently much lower luminosity and radius values. More modern and accurate measurements give a distance around , which gives a luminosity around . A radio angular diameter of 44 mas was given based on the distance, suggesting the optical angular diameter may be around 22 mas. This distance and a luminosity of  were combined with assumptions of the effective temperature of the star, giving a radius of  for a temperature of  or possibly  for a temperature of . However, another paper gives a much lower radius of  based on an assumed effective temperature of  and a lower distance of . There is a Gaia Data Release 2 parallax for NML Cygni of , but the underlying measurements show a considerable level of noise and the parallax is considered unreliable.

NML Cygni lies close to the expected position that a  star would evolve to after eight million years.  Estimates of its current mass are difficult.  One published measure is .

NML Cygni is evolved and a number of heavy elements and molecules have been detected in its atmosphere, particularly oxygen, hydroxyl, and water. It is surrounded by dusty material and it exhibits a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula that is coincident with the distribution of its H2O vapor masers.

NML Cygni has an estimated mass loss rate of 4.2 to  per year, one of the highest known for any star. The annual parallax of NML Cygni is measured to be around 0.62 milliarcseconds. From the observations, it is estimated that NML Cygni has two discrete optically thick envelopes of dust and molecules. The optical depth of the inner shell is found to be 1.9, whereas that of the outer one is 0.33.  These dust envelopes are formed due to the strong post-main-sequence wind, which has a velocity .

Because of the star's position on the outskirts of the massive Cygnus OB2 association, the detectable effects of NML Cygni's radiation on the surrounding dust and gas are limited to the region away from the central hot stars of the association.

The church was founded in 1568 by the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, and church and cloister were completed in the 17th century. From 1724 to 1742, the complex underwent reconstruction, which gives the site its present shape, external rococo decoration, and internal stucco details. This was likely carried out by either Domenico Antonio Vaccaro or his followers. In 1929, the conservatory of the Dominican order was transferred to nuns of the Compagnia di Maria and in 1937 it was recognized legally as a school. During the twentieth century, the complex was enlarged and altered. 

The facade facing a narrow street, has an ornate stucco portico. The interior is a centralized with two chapels, a rectangular apse, and no dome. At present, the church is closed to the public.

393,"Edward Robin Upcott (born 29 December 1991) is a five times British acrobatic gymnast champion who was world men's pairs champion in partnership with Doug Fordyce, winning the gold medal in July 2010 in Poland. Before his partnership with Fordyce, Upcott was in partnership with Mark Fyson, who retired in 2009 after the pair had won the bronze medal in the 2008 world championships in Glasgow. With his new partner Adam McAssey, Upcott was awarded the silver medal in the 2012 Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships.

Upcott came to UK national public attention with his membership of the gymnastic group Spelbound, who rose to fame in 2010, winning the fourth series of Britain's Got Talent. Part of their performance was a spectacular throw of Upcott over the heads of the judges, catching him in the main performance area. The prize was £100,000 and the opportunity to appear at the 2010 Royal Variety Performance.

With Spelbound, Upcott holds the world record for 'Highest throw and catch of a person', where he was the person thrown and caught. The successful record attempt was televised on the UK children's TV show Blue Peter.

Upcott left Spelbound in 2012 to pursue other avenues. While still a member, he was cast as a stunt double for Asa Butterfield in Hugo. He works with Doug Fordyce as Brothers of Eden. His stated ambition is to be part of Cirque du Soleil.

Personal life
Upcott was educated at The Magna Carta School in Surrey.

A long-term asthmatic, Upcott has learned how to control this such that it has no impact on his sporting endeavours. His official biography states that, as a child, he nearly died during his first asthma attack.

His younger siblings, Alice and Adam are also acrobatic gymnasts.

395,"Constance Crawley (30 March 1870 – 17 March 1919) was an English actress best known for leading roles in Shakespeare tragedies. She gained notice on the American stage at the start of the 20th century, and later starred in and wrote several silent films.

Biography

Early life and career
Crawley was born Constance Ione ""Emily"" Thompson in Sunnycroft, Wandsworth, Surrey. She was the daughter of Theophilus Wathen Thompson, a wealthy London solicitor, and his wife Maria Elizabeth Abbott, as well as the granddaughter of Theophilus Thompson, M.D., a Fellow of the Royal Society. She became Constance Crawley in 1892 when she married John Sayer Crawley, an aspiring actor who encouraged her to seek stage roles. This resulted in her discovery in a London salon in 1897 by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who gave her the part of Faith Ives in the Henry Arthur Jones play The Dancing Girl.
Later she and her husband became members of the stage company of Sir Henry Irving that toured South Africa during the Boer Wars. Upon her return to England, she created the role of Roma in a dramatisation of The Eternal City.

Crawley and her husband came with the Ben Greet players in 1902 to the United States, where she was understudy to Greet's leading lady Edith Wynne Matthison. Crawley returned with Greet the following season and gained wide notice playing the female lead in Shakespeare roles opposite Greet, and as the female lead in Greet's Chicago and west coast production of the medieval morality play Everyman, whereas Matthison continued the lead roles in the company's east coast productions. Crawley then returned as the sole female lead on Greet's third tour of the States in 1904, with a young Sybil Thorndike as her understudy.

She returned to the British stage for two years, but was back in the United States in 1906 with her own stage company. Elsa Maxwell, who had joined Crawley's company, writes that they opened their tour of North America in Pasadena on the night of the Great San Francisco earthquake, which levelled every theatre on their California itinerary, after which the tour continued with a succession of performances in Texas, Louisiana, Missouri and New York. Although Crawley's Broadway appearances with her company were few, she had success elsewhere, particularly in the midwest and California. She spent several months recuperating in the resort town of Sierra Madre, California after contracting tuberculosis during a 1912 tour of Canada, and then settled in Los Angeles from 1913 on to focus her career on silent films.

Crawley became closely associated with Arthur Maude, a British actor and director ten years her junior, who in 1906 had become the manager of her stage company. He ultimately took over managing her career as well, and from at least 1914 on they lived together at the same Los Angeles address. The two played opposite each other on stage and then in films, including four movies with their own production company, Crawley-Maude Features. One of their film projects was a 1914 screen adaptation of the Everyman play that had brought Crawley to the attention of U.S. audiences. However, their version of the film came out only a few months after the release of a color version starring Linda Arvidson, and neither film received much notice. Crawley and Maude also starred in six films with the short-lived American Film Manufacturing Company (Flying ""A"" Studios) of Santa Barbara, California, which at the time was one of the largest motion picture studios in the United States. Their 1916 film, The Wraith of Haddon Towers, is considered one of the first movies in the then emerging genre of horror films. Crawley's husband remained in New York during these years, where, under the stage name Sayre Crawley, he enjoyed a long career on Broadway. Though they never divorced, the Crawleys remained separated.

Later years and death

Crawley's last major stage role was on 19 May 1916 when the Hollywood Businessmen's Club for the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death staged an outdoor production of Julius Caesar that was performed by a cast of 5,000 to an audience of 40,000 in the Hollywood Hills. Crawley played the role of Calpurnia opposite Tyrone Power Sr. as Marcus Brutus and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. as Cato. Her later stage appearances were largely one-woman shows where, as part of the entertainment, members of the audience engaged her in conversation on topics of their choosing, with proceeds from the show going to charity.

Crawley never fully recovered from her 1912 episode with tuberculosis. In declining health, she took on no more film acting roles after the March 1916 release of her film Revelations, but she remained active in the film industry as a scenario writer, and she co-wrote three screenplays with Arthur Maude. Despite being in poor health in her final years, she was still part of the Los Angeles social scene, entertaining artists and entertainers at her home at 1203 Shatto place, which after her death was set aside in her memory as an art center.

She died on 17 March 1919 in Los Angeles, and her estranged husband John Sawyer Crawley handled the final affairs of her estate, even though Arthur Maude had been her companion for the previous six years. Although her age at the time of her death was reported in the newspapers as 39, she was actually a few days shy of 49, having been less than truthful as to her birth date. She is buried with her daughter Vere in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Personal life
Crawley and her husband had one child, a daughter named Vere Crawley, who was born in 1893 in England. Vere later lived near her mother in Los Angeles, before dying of tuberculosis in 1918 aged 25. Crawley's wit and humour made her popular with the press, who interviewed her regularly. She kept one or more monkeys as pets during most of her adult life, and her adventures smuggling them into train stations and hotel rooms in hat boxes made for popular reading in the newspapers.

399,"The Netcong-Stanhope Cutoff was a three-mile-long line built by the Lackawanna Railroad in New Jersey in 1900. Built as part of the Sussex Branch, this was one of the first projects undertaken by the Lackawanna after William Truesdale became president in 1899.  Up until the building of the cutoff, the connection between the Sussex Branch and the Morris & Essex Railroad was at Waterloo, New Jersey.  Built with the intent of delivering anthracite coal from the west at Scranton, Pennsylvania, to towns along the Sussex Branch, the connection at Waterloo was not aligned to permit trains from the Sussex Branch to travel eastward towards New York.  Although the Lackawanna could have left the line to Waterloo in place and simply built an eastbound connecting switch at Waterloo, there were compelling reasons to moving the connection eastward to Netcong.

First, Waterloo was widely perceived as being a bucolic backwater—a ""canal town"" (on the Morris Canal)—whereas Netcong, only two miles away, was a growing and prospering town.  Second, building a bypass line to Netcong avoided the steepest part of the mainline west of Netcong.  Third, trains would not have to cross the mainline at Waterloo; rather they could wait on their own track at what would be the new Netcong Station.  And, fourth, Sussex Branch trains could be run into nearby Port Morris Yard.

With the building of the Netcong-Stanhope Cutoff, the line to Waterloo was immediately abandoned and torn out.  Vestiges of the old line to Waterloo and the new line to Netcong (which itself was abandoned 77 years later) still exist.  A new bridge over US Route 206 was built in the late 1980s, which preserved the integrity of the cutoff's right-of-way at that location.

403,"The Phuket Range  (, Thio Khao Phuket, ) is a subrange of the Tenasserim Hills in the Kra Isthmus, Thailand.

Geography
The Phuket chain is a continuation of the greater Tenasserim range, forming one of the southern sections of the central Indo-Malay cordillera, the mountain chain which runs from Tibet through all of the Malay peninsula extending southwards for over 200 km. The Nakhon Si Thammarat Range begins 60 km to the east of the southern part of the Phuket Range. Between the ranges there are isolated peaks rising from the lowlands, the highest of which is 1,350 m high Khao Phanom Bencha near Krabi.

The highest elevation is Khao Langkha Tuek with an elevation of 1395 m. As the hills raise directly from the western coast there are no notable rivers west of the ridge. To the east the largest rivers are the Phum Duang River and the Lang Suan River.

The largest lake within the mountains is the Chiao Lan (Ratchaprapha dam) at 165 km2, an artificial lake within the Khao Sok National Park. The mountains mostly consist of limestone, which leads to the karst geography of steep hills. The hills west of the ridge contain several tin mines, mostly exhausted.

Protection
The range is in the Tenasserim-South Thailand semi-evergreen rain forests ecoregion. Most of the mountains are protected in various national parks and other protected areas. These are (from the south) Si Phang-nga NP, Ton Pariwat Wildlife Sanctuary, Khlong Phanom NP, Khao Sok NP, Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaeng Krung NP, Khlong Nakha Wildlife Sanctuary and Namtok Ngao NP (formerly named Khlong Phrao NP).

404,"Bohring–Opitz syndrome (BOS) is a medical syndrome caused by a mutation in the ASXL1 gene.

Presentation

This condition is characterised by characteristic craniofacial appearance, fixed contractures of the upper limbs, abnormal posture, feeding difficulties, intellectual disability, small size at birth and failure to thrive.

Children with BOS can also have recurring respiratory infections, silent aspiration, sleep apnea, developmental delay, abnormal hair density and length, Wilms' tumors, brain abnormalities,  and other issues.

Genetics

Genetically, de novo truncating mutations in ASXL1 have been shown to account for approximately 50% of Bohring–Opitz syndrome cases.

A second gene associated with this condition is the Kelch-like family member 7 (KLHL7).

Diagnosis
As some of these features are shared with other genetic syndromes, the diagnosis is made by genetic testing.

Epidemiology

The syndrome is extremely rare, with fewer than 80 reported cases worldwide.

406,"Santiago ""Santi"" Mina Lorenzo (; born 7 December 1995) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for RC Celta de Vigo as a forward.

He began his career at Celta, scoring 12 goals in 56 games across three seasons before a €10 million move to Valencia in 2015. Four years later, he returned to Celta.

Club career

Celta
Born in Vigo, Galicia, Mina played youth football with hometown's RC Celta de Vigo, and made his senior debut with the reserves in the 2012–13 season, in Tercera División. On 5 January he signed a professional deal with the club, running until 2018.

Mina made his first-team – and La Liga – debut for them on 16 February 2013, coming on as a substitute for Iago Aspas in the 66th minute of a 1–3 away defeat against Getafe CF. He scored his first top-flight goal on 16 September, but in a 3–2 loss at Athletic Bilbao; at only 17 years, 9 months and 10 days, he became the side's youngest goalscorer in the first division.

On 11 April 2015, Mina scored four goals in a 6–1 home rout of Rayo Vallecano, becoming the youngest player in the last 80 years to do so in the Spanish top tier and the first from Celta since 1979.

Valencia
On 4 July 2015, Mina moved to fellow league team Valencia CF after agreeing to a six-year deal for a €10 million fee. He scored his first competitive goal for them on 5 December, netting four minutes from time in a 1–1 home draw against FC Barcelona.

On 18 February 2016, in only the first 45 minutes, Mina scored twice and provided three assists in a UEFA Europa League last-32 tie against SK Rapid Wien, in an eventual 6–0 win also at the Mestalla Stadium (the half-time result was a competition record).

Mina scored a career-best 12 league goals in 2017–18 as Valencia came fourth, despite being more often than not a substitute for Simone Zaza and Rodrigo; halfway through the campaign, the trio had 12 more goals than Real Madrid's ""BBC"" attacking line. The following season, he netted braces in Copa del Rey victories over CD Ebro (round of 32) and Sporting de Gijón (last 16) as his club picked up their first honour for 11 years, being unused in the 2–1 final defeat of Barcelona on 25 May 2019.

Return to Celta
After four years at the Mestalla Stadium, Mina returned to Celta on a five-year contract as Maxi Gómez moved in the opposite direction. In 2020–21, he scored 12 goals in partnership with Aspas' 14; this included both goals of a 2–1 win at Barcelona on 16 May to end that team's title hopes.

Personal life
Mina's father, also named Santiago, was also a footballer. A defender, he played for several clubs in the 1970s and 1980s, including Celta.

In December 2019, Mina was charged with sexual assault allegedly committed in Mojácar two years earlier. His trial date was set for March 2022.

407,"SIP Animation (known as Saban International Paris until 2002) was a French animation studio, and a former subsidiary of Saban Entertainment. By 2009, the company had produced over 390 hours of animated content.

Despite the name, the company was not directly related to the Saban subsidiaries Saban International or Saban International Services.

History

Saban International Paris 
Saban International Paris was founded in France by Haim Saban and Jacqueline Tordjman in 1977 as a record label. The company became a subsidiary of the newly-formed Saban Entertainment in 1980, and in 1989, Saban International Paris moved into the animation field, producing animated series for their parent company. Saban International Paris would eventually enter a partnership with the newly formed Fox Kids Europe in the mid-90s, and so would produce many animated shows for that network in the 1990s and 2000s.

In March 1996, Créativité et Développement (C&D), a company owned by DIC Entertainment co-founder Jean Chalopin, was purchased by Fox Kids Worldwide. The library was absorbed into FKW while the company itself was absorbed into Saban International Paris. With the buyout, a show under development at C&E: Diabolik was placed into the control of Saban International Paris, alongside other projects.

In August 1996, Saban and the German ARD network agreed to a three-year, $50 million co-production and library program licensing agreement. This deal included two new shows which would be produced by Saban International Paris and Canadian studio CinéGroupe: Jim Button and Night of the Wishes. The former premiered in late 1999, while the latter was renamed to Wunschpunsch (or Wounchpounch), and began production in February 2000, being pre-sold to Radio-Canada and TF1 in the same month.

In December 2000, DIC Entertainment announced that they would be co-producing Gadget and the Gadgetinis with Saban International Paris, and that Saban International would hold international (outside of the U.S.) distribution rights to the series, which itself would premiere in 2002.

In 2001, Fox Family Worldwide was sold by owner News Corporation to The Walt Disney Company; this also included Saban Entertainment and Saban International Paris, which were subsidiaries of Fox Family Worldwide. Saban Entertainment was renamed to BVS Entertainment, while Saban International Paris was sold off after Haim Saban departed the same year. 

In April 2002, Saban International Paris announced they had presold a new show - Tofu Family, later renamed to The Tofus, to the United Kingdom's ITV to air on their CITV block. It was also confirmed that the company were working on 3 different shows: Tinsellania for TF1 and Family in co-production with Studio B, Sparkiz for France 2 and ROBO for M6. None of the 3 shows were ever completed.

In the same year, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 49% minority stake within Saban International Paris. The company however could no longer use the ""Saban International Paris"" name and on October 1, 2002, the company was renamed to SIP Animation, with a new domain name for the company website following soon after. On the same day, SIP announced they were producing a TV series based on the Disney-published comic book series W.I.T.C.H., alongside two others they were already working on before the name change (Jason and the Heroes of Mount Olympus and Gadget & the Gadgetinis). All the SIP shows made during this era were distributed by Buena Vista International Television, a Disney subsidiary.

In March 2003, SIP confirmed that they were due to start work on The Tofus, as well as confirming that they would be co-producing the second season of CineGroupe's What's with Andy?, in association with Fox Kids France and Super RTL. On the same day SIP also confirmed that they would produce a W.I.T.C.H. pilot to attract broadcasters into airing the series, as well as confirming that two shows were under development for Fox Kids Europe, one being a 2D show which TF1 was looking into airing and the other a 2D/3D show.

In September 2004, Jetix Europe announced that their next co-production with SIP would be an action-packed cartoon with the working title of The Insiders. Hasbro signed a deal to produce toys based on the show later in the month. The show's full title would eventually become A.T.O.M. - Alpha Teens on Machines, and premiered on Jetix channels all over the world in Mid-Late 2005. In October of the same year, website Kidscreen confirmed that the planned 2D show made by SIP would be titled Combo Niños and that delivery for the series would begin in early 2006. Jetix Europe and TF1 had been on-board with the series, but SIP had also been looking for other broadcasters or countries to co-produce the series.

The company made a call for short film pitches in 2006. In May 2007, SIP Animation announced that the production of Combo Niños had begun. The series eventually premiered on Jetix channels in Europe in mid 2008, and eventually Latin America in December.

In late 2007, it was confirmed that SIP would be co-producing a feature film with Korean distributor M-Line, titled Princess Bari, being the first ever French-Korean animated co-production. The film was rumored to have been completed, but was never released.

In early 2008, SIP introduced a new website and domain name. In its final year of existence, the company produced several television pilots, including Astaquana, Wesh Wesh Express, Ko-Bushi, and The Jokers; as well as an 8-minute short film titled Inukshuk, which was completed in December 2008, and premiered in May 2009.

Closure and legacy 
In 2009, following Disney's full acquisition of Jetix Europe, SIP Animation silently went dormant. On May 12, 2009, the company was subject to liquidation, and SIP Animation as a whole was listed as fully closed on June 11, 2012, with only around 1 or 2 employees remaining at that time.

Bruno Bianchi, who had worked at the company since the 90s, went on to form his own animation company called Ginkgo Animation after SIP's shutdown, and ran it before his death on December 2, 2011. One of Ginkgo's projects had been George and Me (French title Georges et Moi), an adaptation of a 2006 Soleil Productions comic series that had first been picked up by SIP Animation as early as December 2007, and had been planned to start production at SIP at the beginning of 2009. However, by April 2011 this venture of Ginkgo's was considered unsuccessful due to changing priorities in the French animation industry, according to one of the authors of the original comics.

Malaysian studio , which had previously worked as a subcontractor on Combo Niños and Wesh Wesh Express, co-produced the Ko-Bushi pilot and would eventually co-produce a full series under the slightly different title , with the involvement of Zagtoon. Zagtoon itself was co-founded by SIP co-founder Jaqueline Tordjman and also employs several key people who formally worked at SIP, like composers Alain Garcia and Noam Kaniel.

Subsequent ownership 
As of 2012, The Walt Disney Company France acts as a contact point for SIP and its former assets. Disney owns a majority of SIP's programs that were produced when the company was part of Saban Entertainment, which remain under the ownership of the Disney subsidiary BVS Entertainment (Saban Entertainment's successor company). W.I.T.C.H. (produced during the SIP era) is however owned by Disney directly as the company was involved in the production itself (not just via Jetix Europe) and published the comic books the show was based on.

The shows co-produced with CinéGroupe remain in their catalogue, and are distributed by partner company HG Distribution. Gadget & the Gadgetinis is currently owned by WildBrain, via co-producer DIC Entertainment and its ownership of the Inspector Gadget franchise. A.T.O.M. – Alpha Teens on Machines was previously licensed by independent distributor Multicom Entertainment Group, particularly including digital distribution rights. The short film Inukshuk is distributed by interfilm.

410,"Jane Roberts (1792 – after 1861) was an English author active in the 1830s, best known for her account of a two-year voyage to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) during which she visited and described the Swan River Colony.  She had a considerable number of literary and social acquaintances including Augusta Leigh and Lady Cork.  During her own lifetime she was sometimes confused with Emma Roberts, with whom she corresponded, though the two women were not related.  They were about the same age and they were both referred to as Miss Roberts.  Unusually for single women of that era they had also both travelled separately to Calcutta within two or three years of each other.

Early life
Jane Roberts was born in Hythe, Kent, in 1792, the only surviving daughter of John and Martha Roberts (formerly Martha Bedson).  Her father was paymaster of 10th Dragoons and later barrack master at Dungeness Fort in Kent, where he died in 1816.  Her mother died at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea in 1823, and was buried at Mortlake in Surrey, where Jane erected a tombstone to her memory. Two of Jane's brothers emigrated to Australia, one of whom was Peter Roberts (1786-1860), Deputy Assistant Commissary General in New South Wales.  Jane intended to join her brothers in 1829, but for family reasons she immediately returned to England, where she wrote an account of her voyage.

Career
Jane Roberts' first book, ""Two Years at Sea"" was published by Richard Bentley in 1834 and dedicated to the Earl of Munster, a connection that stemmed from her father's links with the 10th Dragoons.  Her first novel, Lowenstein, King of the Forests was published in 1836 by Whittaker & Co, but after this initial burst of activity she gradually faded from the literary mainstream.  Her journal records that she maintained extensive connections with literary-minded people, amongst whom were Lady Bradford and Lady Dungannon.  Lodging in London, she was able to support herself partly through her writing but probably far more by the patronage of Lady Cork, and by means of a pension that was administered by her brother John Roberts (1790–1868), First Clerk and Head of the Promotions Department of the War Office.  The last entry in her journal is dated 1851, and in 1861 she was lodging in the Marylebone Road in London, but her date and place of death is uncertain.

Jane Roberts also wrote a quantity of poetry, some of which was published anonymously, and a number of unpublished poems and draft plots for novels survive in her notebooks.  She was the inventor of The Royal Historical Game of Cards, mentioned in her journal and published by Robert Hardwicke in 1835.

Robinson is a product of the Aston Villa academy. He twice played for Preston on loan from Aston Villa before joining on a permanent deal in 2016. Robinson played internationally for England at all youth levels up to the under-20 side but declared for the Republic of Ireland in March 2018, for whom he is qualified by maternal descent.

Club career

Aston Villa
Robinson is a product of the Aston Villa youth team. He made his Villa debut on 24 September 2013 in the League Cup third round in a 0–4 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, replacing Aleksandar Tonev for the final eight minutes. His Premier League debut came on 19 April 2014, replacing Andreas Weimann for the last five minutes of a goalless draw with Southampton at Villa Park, and he made three further substitute appearances that season.

On 10 November Robinson scored a hat-trick against Havant & Waterlooville in a 3–0 away win in the first round of the FA Cup. Following a successful spell with Preston, during which he scored five goals in 11 league and cup appearances, Robinson was recalled by Aston Villa on 25 November, despite his loan having been extended until January 2015.

428,"Holy Trinity Church, Headington Quarry, is located in the district of Headington Quarry, Oxford, England.  It is an active Anglican parish church in the Diocese of Oxford.

History
The church, designed by George Gilbert Scott, who also designed the Martyrs' Memorial and the Exeter College Chapel, was built in 1848–49, to serve the spiritual needs of those living and working in the then-active quarry.  Its foundation stone was laid on 19 June 1848 by Samuel Wilberforce, the son of William Wilberforce and then Bishop of Oxford, who consecrated the building on completion.

The Lewis brothers, C. S. Lewis and Warren Lewis, began attending here in 1930 and remained active in this church until their deaths, C. S. Lewis in 1963 and W. H. Lewis in 1973.

Above the altar is the Christ in Glory stained glass window, installed in 1951 as a memorial to those who died in World War II. It was designed by Sir J. Ninian Comper. The cloth behind the altar was hung in 1994, and represents the three angels who visited Abraham according to Genesis 18. The chancel organ was built by Kenneth Tickell and installed in 1992.

The church is known for its Narnia window, which features images from C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. It was commissioned from Sally Scott, a painter and glass engraver, and installed in the north aisle in 1991. It was bequeathed by George and Kathleen Howe (née Clark), who lived at 38 Grovelands Road in Risinghurst close to the Lewis brothers in memory of their children, William G. and Gillian Margaret, who both died young. Willie died in 1955, aged 16, and Gillian shortly after her birth in 1945. Both are buried in the churchyard.

The window contains a lamp post, the word ""Narnia,"" Glimfeather the owl, the flying horse Fledge, the sword, shield, and bottle of cordial from the story of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Dawn Treader, the castle Cair Paravel, Susan's horn and bow with quiver, and talking animals. In the top left and right hand corners are the arms of John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame, who founded Lord Williams's School where Willie attended at the time of his death. The models for the children were local and included the opera singer Maggie Cooper, who was the girl on the horse, and Rachel Smith with the owl.

Graveyard

Attached to the church is a small graveyard, particularly noted for including the grave of C. S. Lewis, who died on 22 November 1963. The epitaph on his tombstone, chosen by his brother Warren Hamilton Lewis (buried in the same grave after his own death on 9 April 1973) and taken from Shakespeare's King Lear, reads ""Men must endure their going hence."" This quotation was the quotation on the family calendar the day the mother of Warren and Clive Lewis died, 23 August 1908.

Also notable is the grave of William Kimber, the ""father of English Morris"" as his tombstone reads. Mrs. Janie Moore, the adopted ""mother"" of C. S. Lewis, who died on 12 January 1951, is also buried in the churchyard.

The churchyard contains the war graves of six British Army soldiers of World War I.

432,"George Gabriel de Pellieux (6 September 1842 - 15 July 1900) was a French army officer who was best known for ignoring evidence during the Dreyfus affair, a scandal in which a Jewish officer was convicted of treason on the basis of a forgery.

Early years

George-Gabriel de Pellieux was born in Strasbourg, France on 6 September 1842.
His father, Captain Jean Honoré Théodore Pellieux, served in the 10th artillery regiment.
George-Gabriel de Pellieux entered the military college of Saint Cyr when he was seventeen, and in 1861 became a sub-lieutenant in the infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1864 and captain in 1868.
During the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871) he was aide to General Eugène Arnaudeau and officer attached to the general staff.
He was decorated with the Legion of Honor in May 1871, effective 14 October 1870.

De Pellieux served in Algeria as aide to General Carteret between 1872 and 1878. In 1880 he was promoted to battalion chief.
He was made an officer of the Legion of Honour on 7 February 1882.
He was on the staff of General François Auguste Logerot in Tunisia from 1882 to 1886. In 1890 he was promoted to colonel.
He was appointed Chief of Staff of the 13th Corps in Clermont-Ferrand in 1892.
In 1894 he was promoted to brigadier general.
In 1897 de Pellieux was made military commander of the Seine department and provisional commander of Paris.

Esterhazy investigation
In January 1895 Alfred Dreyfus, an army officer, was found guilty of authoring an anonymous note (bordereau) to the military attaché of the German embassy in Paris, and was exiled for life to Devil's Island off the coast of French Guiana. Anti-semitism played a role in the court-martial verdict. Later Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart, head of the Intelligence Service, found evidence that Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy had written the bordereau, not Dreyfus.

In November 1897 de Pellieux was ordered by General Billot to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Esterhazy.
He issued a report after three days in which he stated Esterhazy was not guilty and the Dreyfus case should not be reopened.
When more evidence against Esterhazy was revealed, Pellieux was asked to reopen his inquiry. He did not review the new material. Instead he attacked Picquart's credibility and again declared Esterhazy innocent.
The minister of war then ordered a formal investigation by Major Ravary. 
On 31 December 1897 Ravary found there was no basis for the charges against Esterhazy.
To close the matter, on 9 January 1898 Esterhazy was arrested, tried and acquitted in two days in a conspicuously biased trial.
Esterhazy thanked General de Pellieux for exposing the conspiracy against him.

Later events
[[File:Pellieux, Georges Gabriel de.jpg|thumb|Pellieux testifying at the 7th session of the Zola trial, 1898, by Louis Rémy Sabattier for [[L'Illustration|lIllustration]] ]]
The well-known writer Émile Zola became involved in a campaign to exonerate Dreyfus, and wrote a passionate attack on his persecutors in J'Accuse…!, published on 13 January 1898.
He wrote, ""I accuse General de Pellieux and Major Ravary of having led a villainous inquiry, by which I mean a most monstrously one-sided inquiry...""
In February 1898 Zola was tried for libel against the officers who conducted the Dreyfus court-martial.
When Piquart took the stand, de Pellieux attempted to discredit him. He accused Picquart of practicing hypnotism, occultism and table turning, and said he was neurotic.
Pellieux called the bordereau'' ""absolute proof of Dreyfus's guilt"".
On 23 February 1898 Zola was convicted and given the maximum sentence. Later the verdict was overturned and a fresh trial scheduled.
In February 1898 Picquart was cashiered from the army.
He was arrested and imprisoned on 13 July 1898.

On 30 August 1898 Lieutenant-Colonel Hubert-Joseph Henry admitted to having forged the evidence against Dreyfus.
He committed suicide the next day in his cell in the Mont-Valérien fortress.

In September 1898 the Brisson government decided to allow Dreyfus to appeal his conviction. This caused rage among the nationalists.
There were rumors that a military mutiny was being planned, led by General de Pellieux or General Émile Zurlinden.
The Brisson government collapsed on 25 October 1898.
Paul Déroulède of the League of Patriots and Jules Guérin of the Anti-Semitic League planned to take advantage of the funeral of President Félix Faure on 23 February 1899 to stage a coup, using the escorting cavalcade led by Pellieux as the spearhead. 
Pellieux first vaguely agreed, then decided against involvement and had himself replaced by General Roget.
The attempt fizzled out. After the crisis de Pellieux was reassigned.

In the summer of 1899 the court of appeals ordered a new trial for Dreyfus.
Before the trial began de Pellieux stood before a council of inquiry to answer charges of collusion with Esterhazy.
At the trial Dreyfus was again found guilty, to general surprise. 
Dreyfus received a Presidential pardon on 19 September 1899, but was denied the right to clear his name in a trial.
George Gabriel de Pellieux died on 15 July 1900 in Quimper, Brittany, France.

438,"Crown Letters and Punctuation and Their Placements () is a manifesto published by the Egyptian Ministry of Education and written by Abdulqader Aashour in 1932. It was released after the creation of the Crown Script to be a manual of sorts.

Crown Script 
The Crown script (, )—is a modern Arabic script fabricated by Egyptian calligrapher Mohammad Mahfouz in 1931 and proposed by then-King Fuad I. The purpose of inventing this script was to implement capital letters into the Arabic script to be used similarly to English capital letters—which it does very well.
Capital Crown Letters are different from small letters in a sense that they possess a loop—or an upside-down لا—on top of them; letters that may connect to the next letter also connect to that loop, whereas letters that do not connect to the next letter also don’t connect to that loop.

In 1932, the Egyptian Ministry of Education released a manifesto titled Crown Letters and Punctuation Marks and Their Positions of Use, which thoroughly explained the script and was very likely the first book ever written in Crown script. Punctuation was also included because, in fact, there were no set rules for Arabic writing and everyone wrote as they pleased; as such, punctuation was just thrown anywhere into a sentence for aesthetic purposes rather than simplifying sentences to make concepts easier to grasp for the reader. Even now, punctuation is very badly abused—this is most obvious on social networking websites.

The manifesto concluded that [see below for supplements]:
 Big letters as shown in supplement one are to be called Crown Letters; taking into account the form in which these letters are enthroned and because they were developed under the will of the Crown.
 Punctuation marks are to be used as shown in supplement two.
 Crown Letters are to be used as shown in supplements three and four.
 The Ministry of Education may use all the wherewithal necessary to popularize the use of the Crown Letters and punctuation marks and all that is required by the implementation of that from integrating them into curricula to the promulgation of their benefits to the crowds to the facilitation of their use in the press.

More accurately, however, the Crown script isn’t really a script of its own; it’s more of an addition to existing scripts. The Ministry of Education’s manifesto specified that Crown Letters may be used with Naskh and Rok’a scripts.

441,"The Curse of Scotland is a nickname used for the nine of diamonds playing card. The expression has been used at least since the early 18th century, and many putative explanations have been given for the origin of this nickname for the card.

Earliest printed references

In a book printed in London in 1708, The British Apollo, or, Curious amusements for the ingenious, a question is posed:

Q. Why is the Nine of Diamonds called the curse of Scotland?
A. Diamonds as the Ornamental Jewels of a Regnal Crown, imply no more in the above-nam'd Proverb than a mark of Royalty, for SCOTLAND'S Kings for many Ages, were observ'd, each Ninth to be a Tyrant, who by Civil Wars, and all the fatal consequences of intestine discord, plunging the Divided Kingdom into strange Disorders, gave occasion, in the course of time, to form the Proverb.

A similar book of 1726 gives the same question and answer, still regarding the question as relating to a proverb. By 1757 the card was described as ""commonly called the Curse of Scotland"" with the explanation that the epithet refers to Lord Ormistoune, Lord Justice Clerk from 1692 to 1735, who suppressed the Jacobite rising of 1715 and ""became universally hated in Scotland"". In 18th-century Scotland, the nine of diamonds was sometimes called the ""Justice Clerk"", and was considered to be the most unlucky card in the pack.

""Pope Joan"" and 19th century speculation
James Mitchell's 1825 Scotsman's Library claimed that the expression originated from the Duke of Monmouth writing orders on such a card before the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679). Despite this, in The Spectator, a reviewer of an 1885 book by George Gomme commented that the reviewer had believed that the phrase had started from an order written on a nine of diamonds card by the Duke of Cumberland (""Butcher"" Cumberland) on the eve of the Battle of Culloden (1746). However he went on to remark that the book claims that ""The curse of Scotland must be something which that nation hates and detests. The Scots held in the utmost detestation the Pope.""

In the card game Pope Joan, very popular in the 19th century,  is the most powerful card, and it is called the ""Pope"". The game is played on a special board on which the middle is marked ""Pope Joan"", and it is used in association with this card. The game uses 51 cards ( is excluded, making the , later called the ""beer card"", a ""stop"") but there is no direct relation with . Gomme's book goes on to claim ""At the game of Pope Joan, the nine of diamonds is Pope; therefore the nine of diamonds is the curse of Scotland"". The Spectator review considered the claim ""more cogent in form than in matter"".

A letter written in response to The Spectator's book review pointed out that the saying was established well before Culloden, and preferred the Pope Joan theory to other explanations. Other explanations given in the letter were:
 That the family arms of John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, the villain of the massacre of Glencoe, include a pattern of nine diamond-shape lozenges;
  That ""curse"" is a corruption of ""cross"" and the nine pips on cards were in the form of a St Andrew's Cross;
 That every ninth King of Scotland has been ""a tyrant and a curse to that country"";
 That a thief in Mary, Queen of Scots' reign attempted to steal the Crown Jewels and escaped with nine diamonds, causing all Scotland to be taxed for the theft;
 That James IV, before the Battle of Flodden, spent time searching for a missing card—the nine of diamonds—time which would have been better spent in preparing for the battle;
 That Mary of Lorraine (others saying James, Duke of York) introduced the game of ""Comette"" into Scotland, in which  is the winning card, against which many Scottish nobles lost their wealth.

An 1864 book by Robert Chambers, upon which this letter seems to have been based, describes the theories as ""most lame and unsatisfactory suggestions"" compared with the Dalrymple theory. The book dismisses the Culloden theory because of an earlier 1745 caricature of ""the young chevalier attempting to lead a herd of bulls, laden with papal curses, excommunications &c., across the Tweed, with the Nine of Diamonds lying before them"".

More recent opinion
In the 1898 edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the ""Pope Joan"" and ""Comette"" theories are favoured, although many of the others are listed; more recent editions venture no opinion. In Gurney Benham's book about playing cards, in describing the game of Pope Joan he gives his own explanation for why this card is known as the Curse of Scotland: ""The crown of Scotland contained only nine stones, as they never could afford a tenth"". Eric Partridge's Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang considers: “the various theories are as interesting as they are unconvincing”. Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland states that the Curse of Scotland ""is usually taken to be the nine of diamonds playing card, though explanations [therefor] differ"".

Other connotations

Nine of diamonds
The 19th century Tarot of Marseilles is one of the standard designs for tarot cards. It contains a ""Pope"" card (and, indeed, a ""Popess"") but there seems to be no connection with the Pope Joan card game, even though the popess may have derived from the mythical Pope Joan.
""The Nine of Diamonds"" is the title of a book about close-up magic, produced by a Scottish collective of magicians, which includes references to the myths and tales about the card.

Curse of Scotland
The expression ""Curse of Scotland"" is sometimes used simply to refer to an occasion of bad luck at cards and can also refer generally to unwanted situations in Scotland, such as swarms of midges.

There is a theatrical superstition, sometimes called the Scottish curse, that speaking the name Macbeth in the theatre brings bad luck. Hence ""the Scottish Play"" is used to refer to Shakespeare's play.

446,"Alhaji Ganiyu Akanbi Bello (10 July 1930 – 5 June 2014) was a prominent Yoruba community leader and business tycoon.

Background
Dr. Alhaji G A Bello, a Yoruba community ambassador in Kano, was the chairman and chief executive of Criss Cross Ltd. He was popularly known as G A Bello.

Bello was born in Oyo State, Nigeria on 10 July 1930 to Abdullahi Yusuf and Sinota Bello, the second of three children. Both parents died while he was a child and he was sent to live with his uncle who refused to send him to school. He left his uncle and started cutting wood in order to fund his school fees. 

Bello married Sakirat Ayoka Ogabi in approximately 1959. Their first child named Tawakalitu Bello Sanusi, was followed by Moriliatu Bisola Bello Sanusi, Basira Biodun Bello Oyefeso, and a son Nurudeen Bello. Between 1966 and 1967, during the Nigerian Civil War, known as the Biafran War, Bello sent his wife and children to Lagos while he remained in Kano. His family returned shortly after to join him, and they had their fifth child, Shamsideen Bello. His sixth child, Fausat Bello, was born around 1970 but died of measles as an infant. They were married until his death in 2014. In 2015, she has since been in a political asylum after the emergence of Mohamadu Buhari as the next president. 

In 1950, Bello joined the Nigerian Police under British colonial rule. During the time he was a police officer, his closest friend was Alhaji Ado Bayero, the Chief of the Nigerian Police Force who was later appointed Emir of Kano in 1963. He resigned around 1958 and founded a company which dealt in Building and Civil Engineering.

His company was the first to build a multi-storey building in Kano on Odutola Street which was a residential estate. He later bought his first private residence along Abedee Street Sabon Gari, Kano. He opened the first filling station in Kano in 1968 and behind it he opened a club known as the Criss Cross Club which sold drinks, chicken, and pepper soup. His company built its first hotel, the Criss Cross Hotel, in 1971. His second hotel, known as Gab Hotel, and was built in 1980.

His two eldest daughters, Tawakalitu and Moriliatu, married on the same day in 1988. Tawa married Dr Lukman Sanusi while Morili married Retired Colonel Olawale Sanusi. In 1989, his youngest daughter, Basira, married Sakiru Olanipekun Oyefeso, the founder and managing director of Standard Trust Assurance Company. His eldest son, Nuru, married Salawat Titilope.

From 1990 to 2000, G A Bello was the Vice-Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association (IPMAN) in the Kano Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC).

Personal life

Education

Even though Bello only had a secondary school education, he was a great believer in it and each of his children attended university.

Hobbies

In the 1970s Bello loved playing golf on the golf course opposite the Daula Hotel along Murtala Mohammed Way. He also sponsored the Black Scorpion Football Club during that time.

Business life

Government

Bello was an advocate of unity in Kano. He encouraged the government to foster unity between the different tribes in Kano State. He advised the government to encourage Nigerians to stop tribalism and live in harmony. This encouraged the Yorubas to continue to live in Kano. In January 2006, Bello was the acting Oba of the Yoruba Community in Kano State for sixty days.

Mosque

Bello contributed to many Islamic causes in Kano including the construction of two Juma't Mosques built in Sabon Gari, a non-native's settlement area. The first mosque was built around 1982 at Nomans Land, Kano and it was commissioned by the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero. In early 2000, he built a second mosque, the Ahammadiya Mosque along Emir Road, for the Ahmadiya Muslims.

Charity

Alhaji Bello donated millions of naira to charity related issues, including the Rotary International. He donated equally generously to communities, Mosques and Churches. This earned him a long list of honorary awards.

Titles/Awards
Bello held many Chieftaincy titles such as: Aarre Egbe Omo Balogun Maiyegun of Ibadanland, Babasaiye of Owu, Abeokuta of Ogun State, and Aarre Basorun Timi Agbale of Ede in Osun State. He was also given an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Business Administration by Kenton University. He once received a Yoruba Ambassador's award for the North from Central Council of Ibaban indigenes CCII inside Mapo Hall, Ibadan.

Death
Bello was murdered a month before his 84th birthday on 5 June 2014 by unknown assailants in Kano. He was buried in his residence at Race Course Road. The deputy Governor of Kano State, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, paid a condolence visit to Bello's grave on 12 June 2014.

Abubakar Abdurrahman Sadiq was caught by Nigerian police in August 2014 and confessed to the murder. Sadiq had broken into Bello's house to steal money and stabbed him when Bello tried to stop him. Sadiq had previously worked in one of Bello's hotels, but was let go for stealing.

448,"The Montgomery Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is an iconic building located on Church Street in Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina. It was built in 1924, and is a ten-story, nine-bay-wide, steel frame skyscraper faced in precast concrete. It originally housed the offices of textile companies, cotton brokers, and factories. The building also contained a theatre/auditorium space, a radio and television station. The Montgomery Building was the tallest building in Spartanburg until the 1950s. In 2016, a developer announced a $29 million plan to renovate the building for mixed-use to include apartments, offices and retail. Restoration began in Spring 2017 and was completed in December 2018.

History

For almost a century, the Montgomery Building has been a historic structure in Spartanburg. When it was built, Spartanburg County had become one of the two largest counties in the state. By the early 1920s, textiles and railroads had made Spartanburg the Hub City, a prosperous and forward-looking community in the Carolina Piedmont. The city's business leadership recognized that the area's increasing number of professionals and businessmen needed more good quality office space. The building took its name from the Montgomery family, one of the leading families of textile entrepreneurs in the area. It was built on the site of Captain John Montgomery's home, which reflects that up to that point, North Church Street between downtown and the Wofford College campus was largely a residential area. Montgomery had founded the Spartan Mill on the north side of Spartanburg, and three of his sons wound up in different branches of the family textile business.

The new 10-story building sat at the northern edge of the city's business district, on its main north-south street, Church Street. It was only a few blocks from Morgan Square, then as now the city's principal public gathering space. Most of the city's shops and business were only a few minutes’ walk from the building. In the mid-1920s, before widespread access to cars, Spartanburg was a walking city, with most of the city's 25,000 residents living within a mile or so of the central business district. When it opened in 1924, the Montgomery Building was the tallest building in the city, eclipsing the Andrews Building on Morgan Square by two stories. It held the title of tallest building until the early 1950s, and was the city's tallest commercial building until the late 1980s. (The two taller buildings were apartment buildings.)

One of the building's first significant tenants was Lockwood Greene, the engineering company that built many of the area's textile mills. They were so involved with the Piedmont's textile growth that they finally moved their offices to Spartanburg. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Lockwood Greene had designed the Montgomery Building. A number of local textile companies moved their offices into the new building, including the Pacolet Manufacturing Company, which was one of the Montgomery family's companies. Local textile powerhouses Inman Mills, Arcadia Mills, and the Deering-Milliken Mills all occupied space at some point in the Montgomery Building, as did the South Carolina Cotton Manufacturers Association.

The Montgomery Building was home to more than just mill engineers and mill management. In 1926, shortly after it opened, its tenants included several physicians, several attorneys, several real estate agents, and a number of life insurance companies. Other businesses included a cotton broker, the local offices of the Clinchfield Railroad, and the local offices of a coal mining and sales company. Spartanburg's Chamber of Commerce, the Community Chest, and the county tuberculosis association also had offices in the building. On the ground floor, a ladies’ clothing and hat store, a post office, and the theater were among the tenants. After 1930, South Carolina's first AM radio station, WSPA, operated out of the Montgomery Building.

In the 1950s, the building was alive with activity. Some of the tenants included the Ward and Covington Travel Agency, several real estate companies, several life insurance companies, several attorneys, the Harwood Beebe Civil Engineering firm, and some physicians and dentists. Future governor Donald Russell had his law office on the 8th floor. The Spartanburg County Foundation also occupied space on the 4th floor. The ground floor housed a pharmacy, a flower shop, a barber shop, and a beauty salon, among other shops. Several government offices had space in the building. The US Department of Agriculture took up large parts of several floors, with its Soil Conservation Service and related offices. The Department of Labor had offices there, as did the South Carolina Tax Commission. Truly, this was the premier office space in the community.

Even in the mid-1960s, the building remained relatively full, with the same complement of insurance agents, physicians, dentists, and real estate agents. Many of the city's leading attorneys (one of whom was the mayor in that decade) had their offices in the building, drawn no doubt to the proximity of the Spartanburg County and federal courthouses. Most of the federal government offices were gone, though Governor Donald Russell still had a law office there. Lockwood Greene had taken over the entire 10th floor, and the ground floor still had a collection of barber and beauty shops, a pharmacy, and a branch of the post office. A local labor union also had an office there, as did the local offices of the Clinchfield Railroad and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

In the decades after World War II, the city of Spartanburg continued to grow, and the community's prosperity led the city's boundaries to expand. In the years before World War II, Spartanburg had been a compact, walkable city. But the city's expansion, along with greater ownership of cars, led many Spartans to move further away from downtown. New neighborhoods on the city's east and west sides drew young families, and new shopping centers pulled attention away from the historic downtown. The neighborhoods close to downtown entered a period of steady decline. By the 1970s, the city saw a growing number of vacant buildings and storefronts around downtown. In a well-meaning but ultimately wrong decision, the city decided to brick over two blocks of Main Street, turning it into a pedestrianized Main Street Mall. That move took a struggling downtown and ended its reign as the city's premier shopping and office district.

The Montgomery Building suffered to some extent along with downtown. The building's Carolina Theater, which took up much of the lower floors, closed. By 1980, the building still had a few loyal tenants. A sandwich shop, barbershop, and a few random offices occupied the ground floor, along with WFBC TV Channel 4, the Greenville NBC affiliate, which had moved its Spartanburg office into the building. Several attorneys had stayed, no doubt because access to the courthouse outweighed any desire to have newer offices. Southern Bell had taken over the top two floors, and Lockwood Greene continued to have offices on the 6th floor and in various other parts of the building. A few other professionals continued to work there. But by 1992, much of the building was vacant, with offices clustered on the first, fourth, and fifth floors. Channel 4 remained on the ground floor, and The Paper, a local weekly newspaper, had offices on the 5th floor. As late as the early 2000s, the Palmetto Conservation Foundation and the Hub City Writers Project had space in the building.

Throughout its storied history, the Montgomery has stood at the crossroads not only of two major highways – both carrying US highway designation – but metaphorically, of downtown. Just blocks from Morgan Square, it continues to sit on a prominent corner within walking distance of the city's cultural center, the regional state university's business school, a new co-op grocery store, the 9-story downtown Marriott, and the courthouse. The neighborhoods near downtown have experienced their own revitalization, and downtown has seen tens of millions of dollars in investment in the past decade. Built during the early 1920s, a boom decade in Spartanburg's history, The Montgomery Building stands poised to take advantage of and contribute to a new boom decade in the early 21st century.

The Montgomery Building, which remains the third tallest downtown, is still an iconic structure, reminding residents of and visitors to the city of its past successes, recent challenges, and future possibilities.

Carolina Theatre
The theatre built alongside the office building was originally called the Montgomery Theatre. Including floor seating and two balconies, the theatre seated a total of 1300 patrons. It was the largest theatre in Spartanburg, and hosted a variety of touring musicals, plays, and vaudeville acts. In 1932, the Wilby-Kincey Company took over management and renamed it the Carolina Theatre, installing a dazzling exterior marquee. In addition to stage shows, the Carolina began showing motion pictures and became the city's premier first-run movie theater. In 1956, though now primarily a movie theater, the Carolina hosted a live performance by Elvis Presley. Over the years, the Carolina underwent a series of renovations to ""modernize"" the interior for moviegoers. A 1970 renovation in particular removed or covered most of the theatre's original architectural details and flourishes. Soon after, the Carolina closed, as audiences now preferred to patronize suburban cinemas and multiplexes.

Renovation

In 2016, Greenville-based developer BF Spartanburg LLC revealed its $29 million plan to renovate the historic building, which it purchased in February 2017 from Florida-based Cypress Lending Group for $680,000.

The plan for this mixed-use project included retail and restaurant space on the ground floor, office space on the second and third floors, and 63 apartment units on the upper seven floors. Residential amenities including a fitness center and storage units were planned the basement, as well as additional office space.

It was a unique renovation project in that the building's thousands of precast concrete exterior panels were replaced with replicated panels made of modern materials and fit to historic standards. The original facade panels were cast using an inferior concrete mix and flawed techniques which, over time, caused the panels to buckle and deteriorate. Molds were made from the original panels, sharpened by an artist to capture all the details, and new panels were created as exact replicas (to historic standards) using the molds.

The developer began renovations on the 10-story building in early 2017 and completed the project in December 2018.

The Carolina Theatre was not part of the renovation project completed in 2018. However, the same developers plan to manage a restoration of the theatre in the coming years.  Input from the local community will be sought to determine the end use for the theatre.

The Montgomery Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Awards and Recognition
The Montgomery Building's renovation has been recognized with numerous awards, including the 2020 Gignilliat Preservation Award from the Spartanburg County Historical Association; the 2021 Palladio Award for Commercial Adaptive Reuse and/or Sympathetic Addition from Traditional Building Magazine; and the 2021 Preservation Honor Award from Preservation South Carolina, SCDAH, and the Office of the Governor.

449,"Raja Rampal Singh (22 August 1849 – 28 February 1909) was a ruler of Kalakankar estate of Oudh (Now in Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh) from 1885 to 1909. 
Rampal Singh was a Congress sympathizer. He was one of the founding member of Indian National Congress Party. In consequence, Mahatma Gandhi and other congress leader used to visit him quite frequently. Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya had very intimate relations with Raja of Kalakankar. The Raja Saheb of Kalakankar had started a Hindi weekly, Hindusthan, in 1883 to spread the message of freedom.

His father Lal Pratap Singh, was a revolutionary during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and was killed in the Battle of Chanda.

Publication of Hindosthan 
The Hindusthan was started by Raja Rampal Singh of Kalakankar. Even though, from the point of view of communications, this place was hardly suitable for publishing a newspaper, the Raja was fond of it and had it connected telegraphically. The only son of his father, Rampal Singh was ambitious. He learnt Hindi, English and Sanskrit, and became an honorary magistrate at the age of eighteen. He went to the United Kingdom, along with his wife. After two years she died and he came back to India with an English wife. He again returned to Britain. In August 1883, he started the monthly Hindosthan from the UK. This was in English and Hindi. Its Urdu edition was also brought out for some time. Later, it became a weekly. The articles in Hindi and Urdu were the Raja's own, those in English of Mr. George Temple's. He returned to Kalakankar in 1885, and started the country's first Hindi daily newspaper Hindosthan.

Hindosthan Published by Raja Rampal Singh and was edited by none other than the founder of the Benaras Hindu University, Madanmohan Malviya. Malviya joined work on two conditions: Raja would never meet him in an inebriated state and would not influence the newspaper’s editorial policy.

Personal life 
Raja Rampal Singh married firstly, to Rani Subhag Kunwar, who died about 1871 in London, and married secondly, Princess Alice (an English lady). He married thirdly, Rani Radha (a Muslim).

Other 
He was president of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha for year 1899.
In 1905, Sir Chhotu Ram worked as the assistant Private Secretary to Raja Rampal Singh.

453,"Kentucky Route 163 (KY 163) is a  state highway that traverses through two counties in south-central Kentucky. It runs from Tennessee State Route 51 at the Kentucky-Tennessee border south of Hestand to U.S. Route 68, Kentucky Route 80, and East Stockton Street in Edmonton via Tompkinsville.

Route description
The highway starts at the Tennessee state line in southern Monroe County on the road where going south, it continues as Tennessee State Route 51. KY 163 then heads southeast passing through Hestand before reaching the city of Tompkinsville, where it meets KY 100 and KY 63. KY 163 then enters Metcalfe County, and crosses KY 90 at Beaumont. KY 163 ends in the city of Edmonton at an intersection with U.S. Route 68 (US 68) and KY 80.
Since the route of KY 163 was moved in 2020 to the 3.8 mile Tompkinsville Bypass, KY 375 acts as a 3.3 mile alternate route of KY 163 in downtown Tompkinsville, as the north and south endpoints are at KY 163.

Since 2002, the first  of KY 163, along with the entire Tennessee Route 51 corridor, and several other routes, is part of the designated route of the annual Roller Coaster Yard Sale, an outdoor second-hand yard sale event that takes place in the first weekend of October. The specified section of KY 163 is also part of the Cordell Hull Scenic Byway, one of Kentucky's Scenic Byway routes.

History 
In addition to KY 163's current alignment through Monroe and southern Metcalfe Counties, KY 163 ran an additional  to end at a junction with KY 70, another major state route, at Sulphur Well. KY 70 alone went northward to Greensburg (Green County) and Campbellsville (Taylor County) at that point. KY 163's northern terminus was relocated to its current location when US 68 was rerouted onto this route during the 1940s. Since then, KY 70 ran concurrent with US 68 all the way to Campbellsville.

458,"""Indian Summer"" is a popular English poem by Indian poet Jayanta Mahapatra. The poem is widely anthologised in important poetry collections and is used as standard reading material in the English syllabus of most Indian schools, colleges and universities. The poem was originally a part of his collection A Rain of Rites.

Excerpts from the poem

Over the soughing of the sombre wind
Priests chant louder than ever.
The mouth of India opens :

Crocodiles move into deeper waters.

The good wife lies on my bed
through the long afternoon
dreaming stil, not exhausted
by the deep roar of funeral pyres.

 *******

Structure and criticism
The poem is remarkable for clear and exact imagery, judicious choice of words and compactness. The diction has a deceptive simplicity.

Although the poem describes a typical Indian summer, many critics have commented that the poem is a veiled commentary on the ""suffering woman"". Some others have commented that it was one of the amateur poems of Mahapatra despite the original poetic sensibility.

History

Origin

Operations

With the SADF

During this era, the unit was mainly engaged in area force protection, search and cordons as well as other assistance to the local police. 

As an urban unit, this commando was also tasked with protecting strategic facilities as well as quelling township riots especially during the State of Emergency in the 1980s.

With the SANDF

Disbandment
This unit, along with all other Commando units was disbanded after a decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki to disband all Commando Units. The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 ""because of the role it played in the apartheid era"", according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula.

The game was delayed due to thunderstorms at 7:51 PM, and resumed at around 9:50 PM.  It was halted again just before the start of the second half and was then suspended at around 12:13 AM. Toledo was leading Stony Brook 16–7 prior to the game being suspended. Toledo wanted to resume the game the next day, but Stony Brook feared its players would not have been able to get home at a reasonable hour.  As there was no room to make the game up later in the season, it was officially declared ""no contest.""

This game was suspended just before the start of the second half due to thunderstorms.  It had been delayed three times due to lightning.  The Rockets wanted to finish the game the next day, but this would have forced Stony Brook to miss its chartered flight and take an 11-hour bus ride back to Long Island.  Stony Brook officials felt this was an unacceptable risk to their players' safety.  There was no room in the schedule to finish the game, and it was officially declared ""no contest.""

Orbit 
During the 2011 opposition, the last opposition of  that was observed,  approached on June 2, 2011 within 0.00231 AU (346,000 km) of the Earth, which is less than 1 lunar distance. For comparison, the distance to the Moon is about 0.0026 AU (384,400 km).

With an orbital period of 369.99 days,  is in a near 1:1 orbital resonance with Earth, and also has about the same orbit around the Sun as Earth. Other resonant near-Earth objects in addition to  include  (the first to be discovered), , , , , , , and  (an Earth trojan).

The Jupiter Tisserand invariant, used to distinguish different kinds of orbits, is 6.039. The orbit has a small inclination of about 0.4 degrees.

JPL and MPC give different parameters for the orbit of , affecting whether the orbit type should be considered an Apollo asteroid or an Amor asteroid. JPL includes non-gravitational acceleration parameters in the orbital solution.

Physical characteristics
Because  is a very small multi-opposition near-Earth object, the effect of radiation pressure on the orbit caused by light from the Sun was able to be detected. The radiation-related acceleration allowed the Area to Mass Ratio (AMR) to be estimated at (2.97 ± 0.33) × 10−4 m2/kg. Assuming an albedo of 0.12, a typical average for asteroids in the inner solar system, this AMR corresponds to a density of about 640 kg/m3. This density is consistent with the density of very porous rock. For comparison, the asteroid 2006 RH120 has a measured density of about 400 kg/m3, and the density of the asteroid 253 Mathilde as measured by the NEAR-Shoemaker space probe was 1300 kg/m3. In contrast, the density of the man-made near-Earth object 6Q0B44E is 15 kg/m3.

488,"Anbarrhacus is an extinct genus of millipede in the family Platyrhacidae known from a fossil found in North America.  There is one described species in the genus, Anbarrhacus adamantis, which is one of three millipedes described from Mexican amber.

History and classification
Anbarrhacus adamantis was described from a solitary fossil, which is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber.  At the time of description, the amber specimen was housed in the fossil collection of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Simojovel.  The holotype fossil is composed of a very complete immature male recovered from the Guadalupe Victoria site.  Mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico.  The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest.  The Guadalupe Victoria site is an outcrop of amber bearing strata belonging to both the Mazantic Shale and Balumtum Sandstone.  The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem.

The holotype was first studied by a team of researchers headed by Francisco Riquelme of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos  with their 2014 type description of the genus and species being published in the natural sciences journal PLOS ONE.  The genus name is a derived from a combination of the Arabic voice word ánbar for ""amber"" and rhacus, which is used frequently as a genus suffix in the family Platyrhacidae.  The specific epithet adamantis was coined from the neo Latin word adamantus meaning diamond, a reference to the patterning on the tops of the collum and metatergites.

A. adamantis is one of three millipede species described from Mexican amber, the others being Maatidesmus paachtun and Parastemmiulus elektron, while a number of other species have been described from the similarly aged Dominican amber.

Description
The A. adamantis male is mostly a creamy white in coloration with a yellowish tone to the labrum and areas of the legs.  The sterna grade between yellowish and brown.  The total body length is approximately  and has a total of 17 body segments plus head. The head is a little wider than the next body segment, called the collum.  The antennae have a total of seven antennomeres that vary in length and form a club-shaped tip. The longest segment is antennomere 5 followed by antennomere 6, and the shortest are antennomeres 1 and 7. Both antennomeres 5 and 6 have long setae near their apical ends, and the antennae have four sensory cones preserved. The upper plates of the body segments after the collum are heavily lobed forming metatergites and paranota. The surface of the paranota, side lobes of the metatergites, have a granular texturing, and the metatergites have a distinct diamond shaped patterning in the texturing. The segments gradually get wider from the head to about two thirds of the way down the body after which the segments start to narrow progressively to segment 17. The male is mature enough to show developing bulb shaped gonopods on segment 7.

489,"Marcos Raya (born 1948 Guanajuato, Mexico) is a Mexican artist based out of Chicago, Illinois. He became known in the Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen for his street murals. His studio is in the Chicago community area of New City.

Early life
Born in Mexico, Raya spent the first 16 years of his life there before moving to the United States with his mother and siblings. In 1964, when Raya moved to Chicago, in the middle of the Civil rights movement of the 1960s, he found that the conditions created by the movement allowed for him to express his political sentiment through his artwork.

Career
Raya paints street murals and also creates paintings, self-portraits as well as multi-media projects. Well known throughout Pilsen for his street murals and involvement in the art community, Raya has also had his artwork seen around the world in various exhibits. ""Within the last three years Raya's paintings, installations, assemblages, photographs, and painted furniture have been featured in four Latino art exhibitions that have traveled Mexico, Japan, and the U.S."" Raya is gaining popularity in the art world outside of Chicago as his works have been shown in the new Museum of Contemporary Art, he has permanent collections in the National Mexican Museum in Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Alfred Smart Museum at the University of Chicago, the Menil Collection in Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Museum of Notre Dame in Indiana.

Much of Raya's artwork is influenced by his Mexican roots. When Raya was a child, he met Mexican street artist Jose Chavez Morado. Raya believes that his encounter with Chavez Morado helped him better understand his goals through painting. Raya remembers his encounter with Chavez Morado, who was known for creating street murals with strong political meaning, and recalls his sentiment towards him and his work, ""I talked to him about how he mixed his paint and his beautiful images. Muralists were men you could talk to and relate to. They painted history and denounced war, political corruption, you name it. And they were also active politically."" Influenced by his encounter with Chavez Morado, Raya moved to Chicago and enrolled at Crane High School where he met an art teacher named Jeff Gottlieb. Gottlieb got Raya interested in art, and took him on a field trip one day to the Art Institute of Chicago, where his interest in art was further piqued.  Being an immigrant from Mexico, and having moved to the United States, Raya had a mixed sense of nationality where he was old enough to remember what Mexico was like, but simultaneously be molded by American values.

The Chicano identity is important to Raya, for he identifies with his Mexican heritage as well as his American upbringing. Mexicans initially adopted the term ""chicano"" because it was initially used against them as a slang term, but then they later adopted it as something to be proud of. The Chicano term, which was formed under a prticualr historical context, has come to represent rebelliousness against national oppression and forced assimilation. Much of Raya's artwork contains Chicano themes, and many times he incorporates political messages in his work as well. In “Our Lady of the New Millennium” Raya pulls from the format of the powerful image of “Virgen de Guadalupe”, and in place of la virgen, is a woman that seems to be constructed of metallic pieces, dressed in scantily clad clothing. Raya draws from his Mexican heritage in order to make a political statement about money, sex, and power replacing religion in today's society. Affected by his heritage, he combines the powerful image of La virgen, and the society in which he is entrenched in today.

Throughout his time in Pilsen, Raya also struggled with alcoholism. Other members of the community were aware of his drinking situation and were there to offer him support. Many of his friends and other artists in the Pilsen area who were aware of his drinking recall stories of running into him at bars or on the street where many times they either took him home, or found him in such horrible conditions that they would take him to the hospital. Raya overcame his problem with alcoholism, and expressed his feelings towards it through his self-portrait “3 a.m. Sunday Morning” In this painting; Raya paints himself face down on a table, empty bottle of booze on the table, with a gun resting near his hand. As an example of how his artwork reflects his personal life Raya depicts himself with his “demons” floating above his unconscious body, showing the viewer exactly what he's struggling with in the rarest form possible.

Personal life
Raya still lives in the same apartment he settled in in 1980 in Pilsen, though his studio is in New City, Chicago. Having overcome his alcoholism, Raya frequently thinks about his friends who he has lost to alcoholism.

One of his more recent works ""Los hijos de la mala vida"" or ""The Sons of the Bad Life"" depicts his old drinking buddies before they died, and Raya expresses his gratefulness for having left that life behind him. Raya believes, however that his life is on the upswing, and although he is climbing in years, he is confident his art is just beginning, and he wishes to continue bettering his art.

490,"Rockhampton Base Hospital is an historic hospital at Canning Street, The Range, Rockhampton, Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. It was established in 1867. The hospital's medical superintendent's residence (built in 1936) and Therapies Block (also known as the Outpatients Clinic and Sister Kenny Clinic, built in 1938) were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 November 1997.

History 
The Rockhampton Hospital site was established in 1867, and was the second site of a hospital in the city. The extant buildings on the site date from the twentieth century. The parts of the hospital which are considered to be of cultural heritage significance include a former Outpatients Department incorporating a purpose built Kenny Clinic dating from 1938; a former nurses' quarters dating from 1929 and a medical superintendent's residence constructed in 1936, along with a substantial brick fence on the Canning Street boundary of the hospital.

A hospital, named the Port Curtis and Leichhardt District Hospital, was established in Rockhampton in 1858, and in 1867 a decision was made to relocate the hospital to a more elevated site on the Athelstane Range to the south of the town centre. A large two storeyed brick building was constructed on the new site to the design of local architect, John Thomas Thorne. This was extended on the late 1870s and additional buildings were constructed on the site in the 1880s all to the design of another Rockhampton architect, John William Wilson.

The Rockhampton Hospital, as it was now named, grew slowly until the introduction of the Hospitals Act (1923) generated a large number of building works on site. The Act brought about many changes to the practice of health care provision in Queensland, resulting in the state government providing more funding to hospitals, bringing about the current system of health care as a responsibility of the state. The Act allowed for the creation of districts, each with a hospital board responsible for fundraising and management issues. Shortfalls in funding were met by state and local governments. The Hospital Board created to oversee the Rockhampton Hospital as a result of the Act, reviewed the entire site, at the time they were appointed. One of the first initiatives of the newly created board and as a result of the Maternity Act (1922) a maternity ward was constructed on the Rockhampton Hospital site in 1928. The Rockhampton maternity ward, which is now demolished, was of a standard plan and form. The next major building work, which was designed by local architects, Hockings and Palmer in 1926, was a nurses' quarters constructed in 1929.

Medical Superintendent's Residence 
Hockings and Palmer, the architects of the first nurses' quarters were again employed on the next building project; the construction of a medical superintendents residence on Canning Street. Many medical residences were constructed on Hospital sites during the 1930s when formal schemes were introduced to house medical staff on site. To complement this building, and foreshadowing the design of the Outpatients Department of 1939, a brick fence was constructed along the Canning Street perimeter of the Hospital site. This was considered an integrating element and was dedicated to the memory of George Henry Sandrock, an early hospital benefactor. The elaborate geometrically designed gates have been removed but are stored on site.

Outpatients Department and Sister Kenny Clinic (now Therapies Block) 

The next major building constructed at the Rockhampton Hospital was a brick Outpatients' Department and Sister Kenny Clinic, also designed by Hockings and Palmer. The building was officially opened by the Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Mr Ned Hanlon on 25 June 1939.

At the opening discussion of the rapid and dramatic increase in the number of outpatients in the five years prior to the construction of the building was given as the reason for it. The Hospital Board had decided that the building would also house a Sister Kenny Clinic for the treatment of poliomyelitis. Two nurses trained in the Kenny method of treatment, came from Brisbane to Rockhampton to provide treatments at the clinic. The cost of the building was estimated at  of which the government had made a subsidy of  and the balance had been finance by a debenture loan from the State Government Insurance Office.

Sister Elizabeth Kenny became a renowned medical figure for her treatment of people with poliomyelitis, an infectious disease causing motor paralysis and permanent deformities. Following an outbreak of the disease in 1931–32, Kenny's unorthodox methods of treating poliomyelitis were more seriously considered by the medical establishment resulting in the establishment of several clinics throughout Queensland, Australia and internationally. Although the benefits of her methods were never fully endorsed in Australia, the popularity of Sister Kenny and of her treatment was prolific. Previously poliomyelitis was treated with immobilisation, but Sister Kenny advocated mobility in the form of massage, warm baths and constant nursing supervision. Despite controversy surrounding Kenny, her methods were an interesting and controversial development in the treatment of poliomyelitis, spastic paralysis and other long term physical disabilities which were unavailable elsewhere.

Kenny opened a private clinic in Townsville in 1932 and soon attracted the attention of the government to her endeavours. The Home Secretary, Ned Hanlon, supported her methods and, through the Queensland Government, financed the establishment of Kenny Clinics at Townsville, Rockhampton, Cairns and Brisbane. The popularity of her work expanded and in 1938 the wing of the new outpatients block at the Rockhampton Hospital became the only purpose built Kenny Clinic in Queensland. At the opening Ned Hanlon, defended the government's financial backing of the Kenny method by saying:""the methods were now in operation not only in Queensland, but in Tasmania, New South Wales and in London. In all those centres a great number of cases had been successfully dealt with and ... the clinic ... would prove a wonderful service to the people of Rockhampton.""The Outpatients' Department and Sister Kenny Clinic have been converted for use as a therapies block. The building is an important example of the work of architects, Hockings and Palmer and similar to their design for the Rockhampton Town Hall. It was designed, like the nearby residence and fence, from polychrome brick with Art Deco inspired detailing.

In the years following the construction of the Outpatients' Department, the idea of a ""modern hospital"" emerged as a departure from the nineteenth century pavilion planned hospital which endured into the twentieth century. The modern hospital was focussed on cleanliness and efficiency influenced by the new germ theory of disease. These values were achieved within the framework provided by a new, modern architecture and characterised by multi-levelled high rise structures incorporating new building and health technology.

As a result of these ideas governing hospital design many new buildings were constructed on the Hospital site. A five storeyed nurses quarters' was built from 1950, designed by Brisbane architects, Conrad and Gargett. In 1952 the same firm designed a single storeyed isolation ward and in 1958 they designed a two storeyed animal house. The next major building was constructed in 1959 when Conrad and Gargett designed a four storeyed chest clinic funded by the Australian Government as part of plan to eradicate tuberculosis and other chest related diseases. In 1970 construction of a new multi storeyed surgical block was commenced. In 1986 the remaining nineteenth century buildings and the 1930 Roy Chipps designed nurses' quarters were demolished.

In about 1997, the therapies block was demolished despite its heritage listing.

Description 
The Rockhampton Hospital is on a large site elevated on the Athelstane Range, to the south of the Rockhampton town centre. The site is bordered by Canning, North, Cambridge and Quarry Streets. The buildings on which this report focuses are the therapies block and medical superintendent's residence both on Canning Street, a fence along the Canning Street boundary of the property and a former nurses' quarters, near the Canning Street entrance of the hospital.

Former Outpatients' Department and Sister Kenny Clinic 
This is a substantial one storeyed face brick and concrete building situated close to the northern corner of the site and addressing Canning Street. The building has an L-shaped plan and a shallow pitched roof comprises two hipped sections all concealed by a parapet. Forming the northern, Canning Street elevation and the western elevation fronting the entrance drive, is an open brick framed loggia. The loggia comprises a number of square headed openings separated by substantial brick pillars which extend upward and project from the face of the parapet above the loggia. The openings are balustraded with brick panels with rectangular cutouts. The parapet steps up, to form symmetrical Art Deco projections over the principal entrances on the two principal facades and at the corners of the building. These projections feature clustered vertical bands of shaped brickwork. The facades of the building are lined with variously coloured brick bands and detailing surrounding windows and on the parapet projections.

1936 Medical Superintendent's Residence 
This building was designed by the architects of the former Outpatients Department and Sister Kenny's Clinic and is similar in material and detail. It is a one storeyed dark cavity brick and concrete building with a multi-hipped roof clad with corrugated iron. The house is sited facing Canning Street and this elevation of the building is dominated by a large, hipped roof porch, supported on brick piers surmounted by double timber columns. The porch is balustraded with vertical timber battening at the height of the brick piers. The interior contains three bedrooms, a bathroom, a lounge, kitchen and dining room. Accommodation for a laundry is under the house. The building is very intact, although the kitchen and bathroom have been refurbished. Two conifers are on either side of the Canning Street entrance.

Fence along Canning Street 
Along the Canning Street boundary of the site is a substantial brick fence, which visually integrates the brick buildings along this side of the hospital. The fence steps down the length of the boundary and at each break features brick piers decorated with strapwork caps. Along the top of the fence is a line of rectangular cutouts, similar to those on the balustrades of the former Outpatients Department and Sister Kenny Clinic.

Heritage listing 
The Therapies Block and Medical Superintendents Residence of the Rockhampton Hospital were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 November 1997 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

The Rockhampton Hospital demonstrates the growth of Rockhampton and its prominence as a large regional centre. The former Sister Kenny Clinic is important for its demonstration of the development of medical history, particularly concerning the treatment of poliomyelitis.

The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

The building is rare as the only purpose built Kenny Clinic constructed in Queensland, although many others opened in converted buildings.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.

This building, which is substantially intact, has the potential to yield further information about Kenny's methods of treatment.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

The former Sister Kenny Clinic, medical residence of 1936 and fence along Canning Street are good and characteristic examples of the work of Rockhampton architects, Hockings and Palmer and designed in a manner similar to their most prominent Rockhampton building, the Town Hall. In particular the former Outpatients' Department and Sister Kenny Clinic is particularly prominent as a well designed corner building.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

The buildings at the hospital have considerable architectural merit, as well composed and complementary structures with significant landmark qualities and are important elements of this streetscape. The former nurses' quarters, also designed by Hockings and Palmer, is a well designed functional building adapted to the tropical climate of Rockhampton with much attention paid to ventilation.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The hospital site has importance for its associations with Sister Kenny and as the principal place of public health care in Rockhampton for about 130 years.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

The site is important for its associations with local architects, Hockings and Palmer.

492,"Novas were an American garage rock band from Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, who were active in the 1960s.  Noted for their harmonies, they became one of the most popular bands in the local area and toured throughout the Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana region, enjoying a following outside of their immediate vicinity.  The group released a single featuring the song ""William Junior"" in 1966.  In the intervening years since their breakup, the Novas' music has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts and their collected work is included on two anthologies.

History

The Novas were made up of members from Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas and formed in 1963 when guitarists John Salih and David Browne began playing as a duo, eventually expanding into a combo by adding Mike Mullen on bass and Gary Madrigal on drums.  They adopted the name the Novas, taken after the popular compact-sized automobile of the time, the Chevrolet Nova.  The band specialized in playing popular surf rock instrumentals of the day made popular by acts such a s the Ventures, the Surfaris, and the Astronauts and did some vocal numbers  by Chuck Berry as well as ""Louie Louie"" by the Kingsmen.  They made their first impression at a Junior High School talent show when they were cheered on by screaming girls, in similar fashion to the euphoria surrounding the Beatles' recent inaugural visit to the United States in February 1964.  They became the most popular band at their school and eventually in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  They eventually developed a sound which included rich vocal harmonies, which enabled them to do songs that most bands could not do and earned them a reputation as having the best harmonies of any rock band in North Texas.  The Novas used black 1950s model Cadillac hearse with their band's logo painted on the side to travel from gig to gig and carry their equipment.  The band played at popular clubs in the Dallas and Fort Worth area.  Several establishments were teen clubs such as Panther Hall, Teen a Go Go, the Action a Go Go, as well as the infamous adult strip club the Cellar, which clandestinely allowed teenage groups to perform.

In 1965, due to parental pressure, Mike Mullen departed and the group brought in David Dennard, previously of the surf band the Esquires, as his replacement.  The Novas showcased a wide range of influences as disparate as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, the Who, as well as much of the soul music popular at the time.  The band grew their hair to reflect the longer Beatle-inspired look, but it caused them problems for in the straight and conservative Texas, where the crew-cut still held sway and where the mere sight of bangs and hair grown just over the tops of men's ears was still considered shocking.

The group began writing their own songs and in 1966 released a single on Dallas' S.T.A.R. label, featuring two of their self-penned numbers, ""William Junior"" which was rife with social commentary about a child of privilege backed with ""And It's Time.""  The Novas played at local venues such as the Studio club and Market Hall and toured, often traveling in a station wagon on a shoestring budget, staying at motels, playing gigs throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.   On March 25, 1966 the Novas made a lip-synched appearance on the local TV show Sump'n Else along with the 13th Floor Elevators and played on the same bill with the 13th Floor Elevators that night at the ""Spring Clean Up"" show held at Market Hall.  The Novas opened for the Byrds, the Hollies, Paul Revere & the Raiders, Mitch Ryder, the Spencer Davis Group, Sonny & Cher, and the Blues Magoos.  The band recorded a number of unreleased songs, including material for a single that was intended for release in 1968 for the G.P.C. label, but never saw the light of day.  With college looming the Novas broke up following high school graduation in 1968.

The Novas' music has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts, and their collected recordings appear on the 1996 anthologies The Sump'n Else Tapes put out by Collectibles Records and William Junior, released on the Distortions label. Former band members are interviewed in Melissa Kirkendall's documentary Teen a Go Go.

493,"Voronezh Nature Reserve () (also Voronezhsky) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict ecological reserve) located 40 km north of the city Voronezh and 500 km south of Moscow.    One of the oldest nature reserves in Russia, Voronezh was the world's first experimental beaver nursery for breeding and studying the beaver.  The reserve is situated in the Usmansky District of Voronezh Oblast, and in Lipetsk Oblast.  It is part of a UNESCO-MAB (Man and Biosphere) Biosphere Reserve.  Its official name as of 2013 is ""Voronezh Nature Reserve VM Peskov"" in honor of journalist and writer Vasily Peskov.  The reserve was created in 1927, and covers an area of .

Topography
Voronezh Reserve is situated in the northern part of the Usman Forest, an isolated forest surrounded by steppes in the western outskirts of the lowland plains of the Oka and Don River plains. The forest was formed on the sandy terraces of the left bank of the Voronezh River.  The terrain is a rolling plain, flattening east to west.  Altitudes range from a high of 165–169 m at the watershed of Voronezh-Usmanka and Usmanka-Baygora, to a low of 90 m in the floodplain areas of the Voronezh.   Only 4 km of the Voronezh river itself runs through the reserve; the Usman river is more extensive.  It is a typical forest river connecting a chain of lakes, reaching a width of 60 m and a depth of 3–4 meters.  The floodplain is low and marshy.  The territory belongs to the ""Levoberezhny pridolinno"" terraced area subzone that is typical of the forest-steppe province of the Oka–Don Lowland.

Ecoregion and climate
Voronezh is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion, a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands.

The climate of Voronezh is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters.

Flora and fauna
The Usman Forest is representative of pine forests growing on sandy deposits along the left bank of the rivers Don and Voronezh.   The tree species in the reserve are a combination of pine (32.3% of the total), broad-leaved (mostly oak) (29.3%), aspen (19.3%), birch (5.7%), and black alder (5.2%).  There is a problem in the reserve with invasive species from the Americas - particularly the Canadian waterweed, the American maple, and the Saskatoon pigweed.  The reserve has recorded over 200 species of plants considered medicinal by local cultures. Over 1,000 species of plants have been recorded in total, and 60 species of mammals.

Ecotourism

Ecotourism is a stated goal of the reserve, in addition to preservation of nature and scientific study.  There is a nature museum (four large halls, including one devoted to the life of the beaver), and a visitor center open to the public.  There is also a working beaver nursery open to the public (""Beaver Town""), as well as a rope park, and an educational ecological trail.  As a strict nature reserve, most of the Voronezh Reserve is normally closed to the general public, however, scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits.  The managers generally require permits to be obtained in advance.  There is also a museum devoted to Vasily Peskov, the official namesake of the reserve.

495,"""Knots Untie"" is the eleventh episode of the sixth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on February 28, 2016. The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis.

The Hilltop Colony is introduced in this episode, as well as many characters from the comic books, most notably Gregory, who is played by Xander Berkeley.

Plot
Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) is seen chatting amiably with Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green) as they return from a foot patrol, but is disappointed to learn that Sasha has been reassigned and they awkwardly part ways. This scene is revealed to be a flashback Abraham has after having sex with Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos), who gives him a medallion she made from the fuel truck's cracked taillight. Abraham says Rosita is ""damned near perfection.""

Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan) is working in the dark, building trellises for a vegetable garden she hopes will supplement their depleted rations. She still has not seen a single bud, but her husband Glenn (Steven Yeun) assures her they'll be okay. They notice Denise Cloyd (Merritt Wever) and Abraham acting anxious about something and run to investigate.

In Rick Grimes' (Andrew Lincoln) home, Paul ""Jesus"" Rovia (Tom Payne) finds himself facing the gun-barrels of Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs), Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Glenn, Maggie and Abraham, who all get their first look at Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) as a couple. Jesus calmly explains that ""knots untie, locks get picked, entropy comes from order,"" suggestive of a philosophy that seeks harmony over control. Jesus reveals that while he was loose, he took account of the Alexandrians' armory and provisions, assessing their food supplies to be very low for his estimate of their population. Jesus apologizes for getting off to a bad start but says they're on the same side, ""the living side,"" and reveals he's from a community much like theirs, where part of his job is to search for other settlements with which to trade. He invites Rick and others to visit and see for themselves.

As Rick's group prep the RV for the trip, Denise gives Daryl some oat-cakes as thanks for his previous efforts. Carl tells Rick that he accepts Rick and Michonne's relationship, and turns down an invitation to go with them, joking that he would not make a good impression with his messed-up face. After heading out, Abraham quietly asks Glenn whether Maggie's pregnancy was intentional or not, to which Glenn explains that he and Maggie are trying to build something, and that they all are. On the way, they see a vehicle smoking as a result of a wreck. Jesus says it's his people, and Rick's group tracks them to a nearby building and rescues them from walkers. Among the rescued are obstetrician Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris), who offers his services to aid in Maggie's pregnancy in return.

The group arrives at ""The Hilltop Colony,"" a community built around Barrington House, a plantation taken over by the state as a living history museum. A stockade was built with telephone poles from a nearby supply depot and other survivors brought trailers with them from a FEMA camp. They are raising livestock and growing crops, successfully supporting their growing population. One of the guards at the gate demands that Rick's group surrenders their weapons before entering, however Jesus is able to convince them to allow Rick's group to remain armed. He confides to Rick that the Hilltop ran out of ammunition months ago; Rick signals his people to stand down and they are admitted inside.

They are introduced to Gregory (Xander Berkeley), the leader and former businessman on the Chamber of Commerce. Rick ominously says he should not talk to Gregory and tells Maggie to conduct trade talks. Gregory immediately belittles Maggie and asserts that the Alexandrians are in great need and attempts to use their food shortage as leverage. Later, Rick says that they came all this way for food and they're going to get it, but Jesus calls for patience as he works to convince Gregory that it'd be better to show some goodwill to Alexandria and build a relationship that could pay back in the future.

Three of Hilltop's traders arrive and angrily confront Gregory. They had been sent to deliver tribute to Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who said that it was ""light"" and killed two people while keeping one hostage, Craig. For Craig's release, his brother, Ethan, delivers a message from Negan by stabbing Gregory in the gut. Rick and his people jump in, but Ethan frantically assaults Rick, screaming that anybody who tries to stop him is killing Craig. Other Hilltop residents are shocked as they watch Rick kill Ethan, prompting the other two traders, Andy and Crystal, to begin attacking as well. Jesus intervenes and is able to break up the fight. Abraham, who became eerily still while being strangled by Andy during the fight, says that he is ""better than alright"" as Daryl helps him up; he smiles, seemingly having come to a decision in his personal life as Rosita's broken medallion is shown discarded on the ground.

After Gregory is stabilized, Jesus explains that Negan is the head of a group called the Saviors. The Saviors came to the Hilltop, issuing a lot of demands and even more threats, resulting in a deal: half of the Hilltop's supplies, crops and livestock goes to the Saviors in exchange for peace. Daryl and Abraham say they were unimpressed by the Saviors they had killed, and Daryl offers to kill Negan, take out his boys and rescue the hostage in exchange for food, medicine and ""one of them cows."" Maggie closes the deal with Gregory, demanding half of everything from the Hilltop in advance.

Andy and Jesus go with Rick's group to execute a plan to take down the Saviors. Carson examines Maggie and gives her an ultrasound picture of her unborn child, along with pre-natal vitamins. The picture is passed around the RV on the trip back, and seems to resonate with Abraham who exchanges a look with Glenn.

The union was founded in 1889 as the Waterproof Trade Union, then in 1891 changed its name to the India Rubber, Cable and Asbestos Workers' Union.  Before World War I it was renamed the United Rubber Workers of Great Britain.  Its membership fell to only 312 in 1936, at the end of a long trade depression, but it survived and by 1945, membership had risen to more than 4,000 people.  It then changed its name to the Rubber, Plastic and Allied Workers' Union.

In 1974, the union merged into the National Union of General and Municipal Workers.

497,"λ Horologii, Latinised as Lambda Horologii, is a star in the southern constellation of Horologium. It is a yellow-white hued star that is dimly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.35. Based upon parallax, this object is located 155 light years distance from the Sun. It is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +28 km/s. Although Eggleton and Tokovinin (2008) list this as a single star, according to Kunzli and North (1998) it may be a binary system with a long orbital period.

The visible component has a stellar classification of F2III, matching an evolved star that has, at the age of 1.4 billion years, become a giant. However, it has just 2.74 times the Sun's radius and shows a high rate of spin with a projected rotational velocity of +140 km/s. The star has 1.76 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating 13 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,848 K.

499,"Margaret Clark-Williams (1910-1975) was an American psychoanalyst, who worked as a lay analyst in both France and England.

Career
Having first come to France in her early twenties, Clark-Williams was subsequently analysed in the States by Raymond de Saussure; before returning to Paris after the second world war, studying psychology with Daniel Lagache, and finding (voluntary) work as a child therapist.

A celebrated series of trial at the start of the fifties saw her right to practice therapeutically as a non-medic challenged in the French courts: after a first acquittal, she was on appeal fined a symbolic franc.  Although the ruling only related in her private, unsupervised practice of child therapy, Clark-Williams thereafter left France for England, with its more receptive stance towards lay analysis.

500,"Christening in Tanum Church (Barnedåp i Tanum kirke) is an oil on canvas painting by the Norwegian artist Harriet Backer. The painting was exhibited at the Autumn Exhibition (Høstutstillingen) in Oslo during 1892. Harriet Backer subsequently exhibited this painting at the Chicago World Exposition in 1893. It is currently on display at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design.

The painting shows a scene at Tanum Church in Baerum. In the background are the open doors; the strong daylight flows into the otherwise dark interior. In the doorway stands a group of people about to enter the church. This painting shows a young woman holding a child as she walks into the church for its christening. In the foreground to the right, a woman sitting on the bench at the back of the church turns to look toward the entrance. Beside her sits another woman in the dark.

Harriet Backer studied in Munich in 1874–78. Between 1878 and 1888 she lived in Paris. In 1888 she moved back to Norway to settle at Sandvika in Bærum. There she began to make a series of paintings based upon local themes. This painting is one of a series of paintings that Backer made featuring church interiors.

Backer also painted another work featuring Tanum Church entitled Entrance Wives (Inngangskoner). This painting shows a traditional local custom where mothers were blessed before attending church services after having given birth.  It was painted in the same year and is possibly meant to be seen as a pendant of her Christening. The subdued palette emphasizes the difference between the women bowed in front of a clergyman as opposed to the explosion of colors with the focus on life outside the church.

503,"Orbiter X: An adventure in the conquest of space was a BBC Radio science fiction programme written by B. D. Chapman. Only a single series was produced which was broadcast by the BBC Light Programme on Monday evenings in late 1959. Presumed to have been wiped and lost, a set of discs of the entire series, recorded for the BBC Transcription Service, was discovered and restored. Since 2016, Orbiter X has occasionally been repeated on the BBC's archive station, BBC Radio 4 Extra.

Plot
The fictional Commomwealth Space Project (CSP), based in Woomera, South Australia, is working to build a space station orbiting a thousand miles above the Earth's surface: Orbiter X. Planned to be a refuelling station for further space exploration, along with laboratories and other services, the CSP has launched the various components for the space station into orbit. But before construction can begin, the first assembly ship, Orbiter 1, is seemingly attacked and loses contact with CSP Control. A second ship, Orbiter 2, piloted by Captain Bob Britton (John Carson), sent to rescue the first crew finds Orbiter 1 deserted and the spacecraft's log missing. Orbiter 2 is also attacked by a UFO and Flight Engineer 'Hicky' (Barrie Gosney) seriously injured. With their spacecraft crippled, the crew have no alternative but to abandon ship and place themselves at the mercy of their attackers. Once aboard the UFO, they meet Commander Gelbin (Arthur Lawrence), the deputy leader of the Unity organisation: a group of technocrats who plan to use Orbiter X themselves and create a New World Order.

Background
Writing in the Radio Times, the programme's creator said:

Production details
The producer of Orbiter X, Charles Maxwell, aimed to make the series authentic as possible. During the studio recordings, the cast wore 'space helmets' to help them to achieve a sense of realism. Harry Morriss and Ian Cook created around 40 different sound effects for the series, with ""as many as four or five effects sometimes being blended together to produce one particular sound"".

512,"The Chinchorro culture of South America was a preceramic culture that lasted from 9,000 to 3,500 years BP (7,000 to 1,500 BCE). The people forming the Chinchorro culture were sedentary fishermen inhabiting the Pacific coastal region of current northern Chile and southern Peru. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in this area. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed mummification and funerary practices. The area of the Chinchorro culture started to receive influences from the Andean Plateau around 4,000 BP, which led to the adoption of agriculture. Much later, it came under the influence of the Tiwanaku Empire.

In 2021, the Chinchorro culture was included in the World Heritage List.

Etymology 
The Chinchorro culture is named after Chinchorro Beach (Spanish: Playa Chinchorro), near Arica, Chile, where the first mummies were discovered.

Geography
The culture was spread across the arid coastal regions of the Atacama Desert from Ilo, southern Peru, to Antofagasta in northern Chile. But the cultural core of the Chinchorro seems to be the Chilean Arica-Camarones region, which stretches between the coastal towns of Arica and Caleta Camarones to the south. There are many archaeological sites around Arica, and around Caleta Camarones.

Description 

The Chinchorro were expert fishermen. They developed an extensive and sophisticated fishing tool assemblage. The people had efficient fishing gear, such as fishing hooks made of shells and cactuses, and stone weights for nets made of mesh fabrics. They became skilled weavers of baskets and mats.

While most Chinchorro sites are located on the coast, some are also found inland and in the nearby highlands. Their lifestyle was predominantly supported by fish, shellfish and sea mammals. There are some large coastal middens that have been excavated. Analysis of the hair and human bones from the mummies indicates that about 90 percent of their diet existed of maritime food sources, with the remaining 10 percent of their food from terrestrial animals and plants.

The Chinchorro type site is located in Arica, Chile; it was discovered by German archaeologist Max Uhle in the early 20th century.

Many very early archaeological sites have been discovered along this coast. In Peru, Quebrada Tacahuay and Quebrada Jaguay have been studied by archaeologists. Further south, there are also the Ring site, and the Quebrada Los Burros. These mostly date to late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs (ca. 11,000–9000 BC). Inland in Chile, there are also the sites of Achas, and Las Conchas, Chile.

Quebrada Jaguay is the northernmost of these sites, and also the oldest, dated to 11,000 BC. Quebrada Tacahuay, further south, is somewhat younger. Some scholars argue that Chinchorro culture developed from these earlier settlements, although the details are still being investigated. The site of Achas is where the earliest Chinchorro mummy (the Acha man) has been found.

The well known site of Monte Verde, which is also near the Chilean coastline, must also be mentioned in this context. Recently, Monte Verde has been re-dated to as early as 18,500 BP (16,500 B.C.).

Chinchorro mummies 

The Chinchorro mummies go back to 9,000 years Before Present, or 7,000 BC. The Chinchorro mummies were much older than those of the ancient Egyptians. Some of their DNA was recovered. The culture lasted for several thousand years, evolving and adapting over the period. The end of the Chinchorro culture is set around 3500 BP.

Dr. Bernardo Arriaza is a Chilean physical anthropologist who contributed much to our current knowledge about the Chinchorro. In 1984, he published a study in the journal Chungara, his first work on the Chinchorro culture. Later, in 1994, Arriaza published a classification of the Chinchorro mummies, the typology that today is widely used by the scientific and general community. In 1995 he wrote an important article for National Geographic Magazine on the Chinchorro mummies, which was translated into several languages helping to promote the ancient mummies at international level. His book ""Beyond Death: The Chinchorro Mummies of Ancient Chile"" was published  by the Smithsonian Institution Press in Washington, D.C. This work was later translated into Spanish by Marlene Onate (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and published in Chile by the Universidad de Chile together with the Editorial Universitaria Press.

The mummies are found to be mostly independent of the age and social status of the deceased, although higher-ranking former members of the Chinchorros underwent more elaborate and complex mortuary treatment. High arsenic concentrations in the environment led to high infant mortality among some of the people, which is discussed as the cause of the development of mummification as a social and emotional processing. The technique of mummification varied over time. In particular, the color of the mummies changed, from a shimmering black produced by manganese to a later (around 2000 BC) red color of the mummies.

After death, the flesh of the dead was removed and their exteriors were modeled using sticks and clay. The mummies were then embalmed with one of the above materials. Red and black face masks with characteristic holes for the mouth, nose and eyes were created by using color pigments and were presumably modeled after the faces of the deceased. The dead were then placed on cloths made of reeds and buried superficially in the desert soil.

Early tattoo
A Chinchorro male mummy bears the earliest tattoo found in the Americas. He has a mustache-like dotted line tattooed above his upper lip; the tattoo dates to c. 2300 BC.

Later developments

The Azapa Phase of local cultural development (4,000‐2,500 BP) was a transitional period between the end of the Chinchorro Phase and the start of the Alto Ramírez Phase. These developments took place in the Azapa Valley near the coast. Around 4,000 BP, the people of the Azapa Valley saw some cultural changes brought by immigrants from the Altiplano. These influences led to the adoption of agriculture c. 3,000 BP, as well as the introduction of ceramics. These later groups no longer mummified their dead.

The influence of the early Andean cultures in northern Chile has been studied by several archaeologists. Especially the influence from the Wankarani culture, and the early Pukara culture from the Lake Titicaca area may be relevant here. During a transitional phase, the Chinchorros may have coexisted with an emergent Andean Tradition along the coast.

513,"Darling Range Hotel was a hotel in Bellevue, Western Australia, on the end of the slope on the Great Eastern Highway at the 'bottom of' Greenmount Hill and just north of the former Bellevue railway station, and over the road from the Helena Vale Racecourse.

The locality known earlier as 'Helena Vale' and 'East Midland', was near the border of the council in the hills above 'Greenmount Road Board' - (now Shire of Mundaring), and the 'Midland Junction Council' (now City of Swan).

In the First World War, it was the nearest hotel to the Blackboy Hill army camp

It was started as the East Midland Hotel, on the earlier name for the highway - the York Road. Despite the name the local councils called it 'The Bellevue Hotel'.

The hotel was licensed in 1905, and its outward appearance changed over the years with change of owners and managers and circumstances.

The owners, Licensees or Managers to the end of the First World War included:-

 Thomas Wilkins  1903-1913
 W.K. Lamzed     1914-1916
 H. Finlayson    1916-1920

The longest connection on record was that of J.K. Robinson and S. Boyd 1950 -1960

It was considered an excellent location and opportunity for owners and trainers with horses at the Helena Vale Racecourse.

It was the base of a lengthy association with billiards and darts for the area.

More historic hotels in the Midland - Bellevue area have been lost due to fire, loss of licence and neglect. The Darling Range Hotel building is one of the few remaining buildings in the area with well documented connections to the troops leaving Blackboy Hill Training Camp, and leaving Helena Vale Racecourse by railway to serve in the First World War.

The building remained, with a different configuration from the first world war era, and was in potential threat of immanent demolishing to make way for a service station development, in an area that already has a significant concentration of service stations.

Bellevue Hotel 
The original hotel building was planned to be renovated in July 2018, according to the Facebook group Remember Midland

As of 2019 the Bellevue Hotel and adjacent petrol station were operational.

516,"Tracey Damigella-Lohse (born  1969) is an American former competitive figure skater. As a single skater, she is the 1985 Grand Prix International St. Gervais champion, 1987 Novarat Trophy champion, 1985 Nebelhorn Trophy silver medalist, and 1986 U.S. national pewter medalist.

Personal life 
Tracey Damigella was born  1969 and grew up in Miramar, Florida, the daughter of Marion and Frank Damigella. She was raised with three siblings – Gail, Robert, and Toni. Her sister, Toni, competed in women's singles luge at the 1984 Winter Olympics.

Damigella has a daughter, Sofia Goddard (born in 1999), with Scott Goddard, a marble granite contractor whom she married in April 1994 in Los Angeles. Now known as Damigella-Lohse, she resides in Cooper City, Florida.

Career 
Damigella began learning to skate at the Polar Palace in Miami, Florida. She represented the United States in ladies' singles for most of her career. In February 1985, she won the junior silver medal at the U.S. Championships, finishing second to Jill Trenary. Internationally, she won gold medals at the 1985 Grand Prix International St. Gervais champion and 1987 Novarat Trophy. She was awarded silver at the 1985 Nebelhorn Trophy and the pewter medal at the 1986 U.S. Championships. Based mainly at the Lighthouse Point Ice Skating Arena in Florida, she also took lessons from Carlo Fassi for five years at the Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her skating expenses, nearly $50,000 a year, were covered mainly by her parents who sold a house in Boston and a motel in South Florida.

Damigella won the ladies' title at the Australian Championships in the 1989–90 season, but never appeared for Australia internationally. In the summer of 1991, she and Doug Williams began a pairs partnership, training in North Hollywood, California. The two represented the United States at the 1992 NHK Trophy and 1993 Nations Cup.

In NBC's 1994 made-for-TV movie Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story, Damigella served as the skating double for Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy Kerrigan. She has worked as a skating coach at the Sunrise Ice Skating Center and Pines Ice Arena in Pembroke Pines, Florida.

517,"Role Models is a 2017 Indian Malayalam-language romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Rafi. The film stars Fahadh Faasil, Vinayakan, Sharaf U Dheen, Vinay Forrt, and Namitha Pramod. Role Models was shot in various locations of Goa and Dubai. The film released on 25 June 2017 all over Kerala.

Plot
The film opens with Gautham being an asocial man, very different from his college days. His father asks Gautham's college friends Rexxie and Jyothish to help him. Coming to know that Gautham insulted a girl during a date at the public library for which her father called him gay as he wasn't interested in females, the two go to his office. But Gautham treats them rather formally. Then they see his boss shouting at him and he listens to it patiently, which they found difficult to believe because he was unlike the Gautham they had heard of. They find out that he isn't gay.

Their college days are revealed showing Gautham being a very social person. He was the lead singer of a band named 'Role Models' which consisted of Rexxie, Jyothish and Subhan, a flirt. They were best friends and everyone liked them but Gautham's parents disliked their son being with them. Then it is revealed that Gautham's parents gave a complaint to the principal with Gautham's signature which Gautham signed when he was drunk. As a result, the three were expelled. Gautham tries to explain to them that it wasn't him who gave the complaint and that they all knew each other's secrets and they should not break up. But Subhan asks him in anger why he kept his love affair a secret and the others are surprised. Eventually, they are separated.

Rexxie and Jyothish tell Gautham that Subhan was having cancer and that he wants to meet Gautham which was a lie.
Gautham goes with them to Subhan's place. Subhan has become a football player and is still a bachelor. Rexxie asks with whom Gautham had a love affair and Subhan tells that it was Christy, a tomboy who they all know. Then it is shown that Christy had written a love letter to Gautham which was caught by the principal.

The three of them bring back Christy, who is getting married in a month. But Gautham is unhappy to see her and reveals that it was he who had given the letter to the principal. Hearing Gautham's answer she tries to beat him. Then he reveals that he used to like Shreya and not Christy. Reuniting with Shreya and solving issues between Shreya and Gautham's parents form the rest of the plot.

522,"Grand Sky is a UAS (unmanned aerial systems)-specific business and aviation park located at Grand Forks Air Force Base  near Grand Forks, North Dakota. A groundbreaking for the development was held in September 2015, making it the first UAS business and aviation park in the U.S. The park consists of 217 acres and includes access to the Grand Forks Air Force Base runway for large UAS flights.

Tenants
Initial tenants at Grand Sky include General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman was the first tenant to begin construction at the park. The company broke ground for a 36,000-square-foot facility in October 2015 to be used for research, training and operations. Northrop Grumman makes the Global Hawk, a large UAS that is also flown by the military at Grand Forks Air Force Base.

General Atomics Aeronautical Systems conducted the first large UAS flight at the park, a launch and recovery of a Predator A aircraft, in July 2016. The company operates a UAS Flight Training Academy at the park and graduated its first class of aircrews on Aug. 12, 2016.

Future development
In December 2016, Grand Forks-based EdgeData LLC signed a letter of intent to construct a 16,000-square-foot data center at Grand Sky which will offer data storage for tenants at the park. Data collection and distribution is expected to be a significant factor in the commercial use of UAS.

Also in December 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration granted approval to the Northern Plains UAS Test Site to conduct beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights from Grand Sky. It is the first location in the U.S. to receive approval for BVLOS flights and allows for greater support of testing, development and evaluation of UAS technologies.

528,"Professor Brian Glüss FRSS (23 August 1930 – 26 December 2013) was a statistician, mathematician, systems engineer and author. He also became an expert on victims of violent death in war and peace, on the process of healing their families and on the condition of survivor guilt.

Early life
Brian Glüss was born in London on 23 August 1930, the son of Joseph Glüss and Otilie (née Tenenhaus). His father, known as ""Mottle"", was from Russia and his mother, known as ""Tilly"", was from Botosani in Romania. They were all Jewish. In 1940, the family suffered tragedy when their London home was hit by a German bomb killing Glüss's grandmother Anna Tenenhaus nee Goldshlager and his brother, Michael. The family moved to Bedford and Glüss was educated in the town at Bedford Modern School where he excelled. After National Service with the Royal Air Force, Glüss went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, on a state scholarship, matriculating in 1949 and taking the Mathematical Tripos. On graduation he was made a Pembroke Foundation Scholar and he took the Diploma in Mathematical Statistics in 1953.

Career
On leaving Cambridge, Glüss was made research assistant to Professor Maurice Kendall (later Sir Maurice Kendall), an esteemed statistician who was then at the London School of Economics. After the LSE he worked as an actuarial clerk at Prudential Assurance in London before leaving England for America in 1954 having been contracted to work on the Jury Project at the University of Chicago. At the end of his contract he went to Ottawa as an Assistant to the Senior Researcher in the Bureau of Statistics of the Canadian Government between 1956 and 1958. At the end of his tenure at Ottawa, he returned to Chicago and became a staff member at the Illinois Institute of Technology between 1958 and 1962 before studying for a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Berkeley University; he was awarded his PhD in 1965.

After Berkeley, Glüss moved to Santa Monica, California, where he worked for the RAND Corporation under Richard Bellman, an American applied mathematician and pioneer of dynamic programming, a subject on which Glüss wrote 'a well received book'. Following his time at the RAND Corporation he was made a Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and, later, Emeritus Professor following his retirement in 1988.

Work on survivor guilt and charitable causes
Glüss didn't speak about the tragic circumstances that had befallen his family until he was 25, but instead found consolation in the work of William Niederland, a New York psychoanalyst who had observed, examined and worked with 2,000 survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. Writing to his old school in 2006 about his own experience and his respect for Niederland, Glüss commented:

To varying degrees, he [Niederland] found a bundle of common symptoms, which he later termed survivor guilt.  Then, in the 1950s, he went on to examine peacetime survivors, in the US, who had lost loved ones to violent death in peacetime, by murder, suicide, violent accident.  Again, in varying degrees, the same symptoms cropped up.  Discovering Neiderland was the key to my final recovery.  Without him I’d still be in generalized grief.  When I work with survivors, I use his method

Inspired by Niederland, Glüss used his own experiences to help others in one-on-one work with other survivors. He engaged in voluntary work in retirement homes in Berkeley, California, and was a voluntary mentor for victims of grief.

Personal life
Whilst at Berkeley, Glüss married Joan Marie Chodorow, a therapist. The marriage was difficult and ended in divorce but he was fond of his stepchild, Lori Kim Smallwood. A life already beset by tragedy, his stepdaughter was murdered in 1980 which led to Glüss campaigning against handgun ownership; his writings influenced the San Francisco and Berkeley gun control ordinances of 1982. After that sad event and retirement, he devoted his life to charitable and political causes; the tragedies he'd faced ‘did not diminish his cheerfulness and optimism’. He died on Boxing Day 2013 in Berkeley.

He rose to fame when he participated in the third series of the ITV2 dating reality competition Love Island in 2017. After his stint on the programme, he began appearing in the MTV reality show Geordie Shore, debuting in the sixteenth series in 2018.

Early life
Gowland was born on 2 August 1995 in Middlesbrough, England and was raised in Thornaby-on-Tees. After leaving school, he became an oil rig worker.

Gowland is the cousin of footballer Jonathan Grounds, who currently plays for Championship club Birmingham City.

Career
On 29 May 2017, Gowland was unveiled as one of the eleven original contestants for the third series of the ITV2 dating reality competition Love Island. During his first stint on the series, he was ""coupled up"" with four different women, originally with Camilla Thurlow. On Day 23, he was ""dumped"" from the programme, alongside Chloë Crowhurst; Gowland had been coupled up with her and Crowhurst had also been an original contestant. However, Gowland and fellow ""dumpee"" Mike Thalassitis returned to the programme on Day 39, in which they became the first Islanders to return to the villa having been dumped from the island, after being voted back in a recent public vote. Gowland then coupled up with Georgia Harrison, before they were dumped together on Day 46, just a week after his return and days prior to the live final.

Five months after Love Island concluded, in December 2017, it was confirmed that Gowland would join the cast of the sixteenth series of MTV reality show Geordie Shore, which commenced on 9 January 2018. Gowland was notable for his row with fellow cast member Alex MacPherson in the seventeenth series after the latter made unintentional sexual advances towards Gowland's girlfriend Chloe Ferry and voluntarily leaving the house in the tenth episode after sustaining a minor injury before returning in the following episode. In October 2019, it was confirmed that Gowland, as well as his co-star Tahlia Chung, would not be returning for the twenty-first series, ending long-running speculation over his future as a result of the breakdown of his and Ferry's relationship.

536,"Qahtān (, also spelled as ) to distinguish between the tribe and the Qahtanite peoples, is an Arab tribal confederation. Qahtan is composed of three main tribes: Sanhan, Junb, and Rufaida. Today, members of the tribe and its sub-tribes are based in Yemen (where most of the tribe is congregated), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates.

Qahtan's sheikhdom was unanimously agreed by Western historians to be in the hands of the 'Al Qarmalah' family of the Jahader clan in the 19th century, and as early as 1961, the paramount sheikh of Qahtan was reported to be 'Khalil ibn Nasir ibn Qarmalah' (a descendant of Hadi ibn Qarmalah).

History

Al Qarmalah
The Qahtan tribe enjoyed It settled in one of the Najd regions known as Al-Quwai'iyah and expanded its influence in southern Najd, but Najd is subject to the rule Ibn Saud in the second Saudi state.
Several historians have described Qahtan as It became one of the powerful tribes of Najd for a while and then left for its original home in the south.

The Jahader branch of the Sanhan sub-tribe of Qahtan migrated to southern Najd from their homelands in Asir Region during the late 18th century and early 19th century under the leadership of Athfar al-Amaaj, Then they fought with an Alawite branch of the Mutair tribe at Jabal Subha in Al-Quwai'iyah, and Qahtan won in the battle and settled in Al-Quwaiyah, where they stayed for a period of time, then they returned to their homeland in the south because of the wars

Bahrain
Bahrain is a Gulf country that houses the tiniest number of Qahtanis compared to other Gulf countries, however, some members of the tribe have taken a relatively prominent role in the country. For example, the head of the Sunni Waqf Endowment Directorate is Rashid al-Hajri, a member of the Bani Hajer. Offshoot Hajri families such Almuhannada also take a public role such as former Member of Parliament Hamad Almuhannadi.

Notable members
 Saud al-Qahtani, former Advisor of the Saudi Royal court and the former General Supervisor of the Center for Studies and Information Affairs at minister rank.

539,"Tom Chaloner (2 June 1839 – 3 April 1886) was an English jockey who won ten British Classic races, each of them except the 1,000 Guineas at least once. Although he won races across the country, his most notable came in the north of England.

Early life
Chaloner was born in Manchester on 2 June 1839, to Thomas Chaloner and Mary Thomson. He was baptized on 10 July 1839 in Manchester Cathedral. In September 1852, along with his two brothers Willie and Dick, he moved to Ashgill in Yorkshire to work for trainer John Osborne. He fell in love with Osborne's daughter, Ellen, and married her in spring of 1865. He would have eight children with her. The family lived at Spring Cottage, Malton, North Yorkshire.

Racing career

1850s

His first public ride was at Carlisle in June 1853, riding at 4 st 7 lbs. His first win came in a selling stakes at Liverpool on Thursday 12 July 1855. Osborne took him on as apprentice for years, thinking him to have great skill and judgement.

Over the next couple of years, he won a number of races which helped establish his reputation. In 1856, he won the Northumberland Plate on Zeta for Lord Zetland. Then in 1857, he took the Great Northern Handicap on Skirmisher, and on Vedette, the Doncaster Cup. His ""quiet and unassuming manner... [and] undeniable talent"" meant he was soon in demand.

He won the Great Metropolitan Handicap on Telegram at the start of 1858, and, building an association with some of the leading owners of the time, he won the Bath and Somersetshire Stakes on East Langton, the Royal Hunt Cup on Hesperithusa, the Chesterfield Stakes on Peggy Taft, and the Chesterfield Cup on Sunbeam. 1859 was less successful.

1860s

He won the 1860 Goodwood Stakes on Wallace and Liverpool July Cup on Moorcock. He also rode in the Derby for the first time, finishing third behind Thormanby on Horror. His biggest win of the season was in the Doncaster Cup on Sabreur, but getting his first ride in the St Leger at the same track, he finished nowhere on Wallace.

He had his first ride in the 2,000 Guineas in 1861 on Gardener, though the horse performed poorly. Later in the year, though, he won his first Classic, the St Leger on the filly Caller Ou for William l’Anson. The horse was a 100/1 outsider, and beat the Derby winner Kettledrum to win it. The race was a ""brilliant affair"", with Chaloner, and Kettledrum's jockey, Luke Snowden, ""riding as if for their lives"". Chaloner was not even the original jockey for the race. Jemmy Grimshaw, who had been approached to ride, thought so little of the horse, that he begged to be allowed to ride Camerino instead.

The win brought Chaloner to the attention of trainer Jem Godding, who invited him to Newmarket to ride for him. For Godding, he won the 1862 Oaks on Feu de Joie, owned by gambler Richard Naylor. Chaloner won a second St Leger the same year, on The Marquis. However, he was once again unsuccessful in the 2,000 Guineas, riding Caterer.

The next year changed that. Naylor also owned a horse called Macaroni which lost its only race as a two-year-old in a two horse race, but in which Naylor had confidence. He backed him throughout the winter to win the following year's Derby. Chaloner was booked to ride throughout the horse's three-year-old season.

After winning the 1863 2,000 Guineas on Macaroni, beating Saccharometer, the horse went to the 1863 Derby as well. The race was run in appalling wet weather, the first wet weather Derby since 1857, and took 34 false starts before getting underway. Horses were ""almost up to their fetlocks in dir"". Macaroni had in fact tried to bolt on the way down to the start, and several other horse became fractious as they waited.

Tattenham Corner was treacherous, and as the runners bunched on the turn, jockey D Hughes on second favourite, and vanquished Guineas rival, Saccharometer screamed for room. Saccharometer clipped the heels of the horse in front and fell heavily. Another horse, Fantastic, jumped over the stricken Saccharometer and fell on his nose and knees, bringing down Johnny Daley on King of the Vale in the process. At this point, Macaroni was behind Lord Clifden, ridden by George Fordham. At the furlong marker Lord Clifden was still ahead, but Fordham looked round at a crucial moment, allowing Chaloner to take his chance. Fordham then switched his whip, Lord Clifden faltered twice, the second time after treading on a piece of orange peel, and Macaroni was forced up to win by a head. Some were sure Lord Clifden won, and remained so years afterwards. It was called one of the ""most gallant finishes ever witnessed"".

From l'Anson, Chaloner picked up a ride on Blair Atholl, winner of the 1864 Derby. The horse's regular jockey, Jim Snowden was an alcoholic, so Chaloner was made his replacement for the valuable Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. 
The voyage was rough and the welcome cold. On course, Chaloner was threatened with physical attack and the crowd threw things at horse and jockey on the way to the start. Nonetheless, Blair Atholl finished second.

Chaloner won further St Legers on Achievement (1867) and Formosa (1868), and dead heated for the 1868 2,000 Guineas on Moslem in a finish that ""will never be forgotten"". He also won the 1869 Middle Park Plate on Frivolity, beating the highly regarded Sunshine and Kingcraft.

1870s and retirement

He won the 1870 Ascot Stakes on Musket, and, in the same week, the 1870 Alexandra Plate on Trocadero. He did not win any of the biggest races of 1871, but his ""nerve, judgement, and resolute style of finishing"" were still in evidence, and although losing on Sterling in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, it is said he was ""never seen to greater advantage"".

Among 29 victories in 1872, were the Alexandra Plate on Musket, the Queen's Gold Vase on Albert Victor, the Great Yorkshire Stakes on Dalnacardoch, and six wins on Cantiniere.

Two more Classics were still to come - the 1873 2,000 Guineas on Gang Forward and the 1875 St Leger on Craig Millar, but over the rest of the 1870s his win record progressively tailed off, until, struggling to reach riding weight, he retired.

Later life
Chaloner was ""a reliable and unassuming man"" and from his racing earnings bought a pub for his parents.

After retiring from riding, Chaloner began a training career, but shortly after taking it up, his health began to fail. He did have one major success - trained the 1884 2,000 Guineas winner, Scot Free.

Chaloner died at Osborne House on 3 April 1886, aged 46,/ not known although some sources give his age at death as 47. He left an estate worth £799 1s. 6d.

His wife Ellen retained her husband's training license – an unusual occurrence for the times - and continued to ride out until well into her nineties, dying on 5 March 1944. She is buried in St Agnes Church, Newmarket.

Their son, Tom Chaloner Jr, won the 1895 Cambridgeshire Handicap, dedicating it to the memory of his father, and became a trainer at Newmarket. Two other brothers - Philip Arrowsmith and George - also became trainers, while another brother Richard became a jumps jockey. George had also briefly been a jockey, but had to give it up due to problems with his weight.

Riding style
Chaloner had a peculiarity in his seat when he rode, but was still considered the ""beau ideal"" of a jockey, ""combining coolness with consummate ability"". He was a great judge of pace, and very patient.

540,"Mary Alfreda Smith is an American political and LGBT activist, working in the areas of women's and minority rights. She worked on the Robert F. Kennedy election campaign in 1968, and helped overturn laws that criminalized homosexual activity in California. In 1972 she became the first ordained female minister of the Metropolitan Community Church.

Early life and education 

Smith was born on November 22, 1935, in Pocatello, Idaho. Her parents left Depression-era Oklahoma to settle in Idaho shortly before she was born. Mary was adept in math and science in school. Her parents, Alfred and Mary, moved the family along with their three children to a remote area, along with Alfred's grandmother who was the Nazarene preacher Lydia Harriet Smith, who had rescued Alfred from a Denver orphanage and raised him in the small churches she served at. Freda's early life revolved around the Nazarene Church. The area was primarily LDS at the time, with the Smiths being the sole exception. Besides minor differences in dogma (dancing, drinking coffee, etc.) both religions were against sin in any form, and for chastity, holiness, and a strong work ethic.

Freda attended church twice weekly, and home meetings involved hymns, Bible study, and prayer. Believers struggled against temptation and despair, and had joyful, optimistic renewals of faith and optimism in the sense of God's presence. This influenced Freda early, and she felt a calling to be a preacher, or a poet.

After the war years and the death of Smith's grandmother, the family began to drift from the Nazarenes.  Shea left and became a member of the Salvation Army, whose fire and compassion for lost souls stirred her. Around this time, she recognized her lesbianism, and struggled against it, leaving Idaho to live with her uncle and aunt in Texas. While there, she scoured the library for everything she could find on the subject. Everything she read was frightening; homosexuality in the 1950s was universally condemned. She prayed, but nothing changed. She felt that God did not want to change her, but wanted to use her passion as she was, to help those like her who were struggling.

Smith left Texas to return to Pocatello to attend Idaho State College, majoring in speech and journalism. She was still praying for a cure, and felt a strong calling to preach, gaining practice in public speaking by joining the debate team in college.  She finally realized she could not change her basic nature. Following a witch hunt against homosexuals in Boise in 1955–56, Smith left Idaho to find others like her, and ended up in California where she discovered a gay community.

Smith entered the California State University at Sacramento, majoring in English and psychology, graduating with a master's degree and became a licensed marriage and family therapist.

Career 

In California, Smith became a political activist and an activist for gay rights.

Using her passion about human rights, she joined the Bobby Kennedy Presidential election campaign in California in 1968. When he was assassinated, she decided to come out as a lesbian and a feminist and work to change laws in California. Coming out publicly was rare in those days before Stonewall; homosexuality was still against the law in California, was condemned by the Church, and considered to be a mental disease. She became co-chair of the California Committee for Sexual Law Reform and worked for the passage of Assemblyman Willie Brown's Assembly Bill 489 (Consenting Adult Sex Bill). She read her poem ""Dear Dora/Dangerous Derek Diesel Dyke"" to state legislators, including Lt. Gov. Mervyn M. Dymally who voted to break a tie in the California Senate and cause the bill to become law in 1975.

During her efforts to reform the law, Smith learned of the Metropolitan Community Church which had been founded by the Rev. Troy Perry in 1968. She felt her calling, and joined the church. 
In 1972, Smith became the first woman minister and first lesbian to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church. The next year, she convinced the denomination to change its bylaws to use pronouns ""he and she"". She was the first woman elected to the board of elders in 1973, at the fourth general conference in Atlanta, when the board was expanded from four members to seven.

In Denver in 1975, she co-performed with Robert Sirico the first U.S. same-sex wedding with a government-issued civil marriage license. Ultimately, the MCC became a leader in Christian social action, promoting women's equality including ordination of women clergy, inclusive language, and a theology of inclusion for everyone.

Smith served as senior pastor of MCC Sacramento from 1972 to 2005. In 2005, she retired and became director of the Reverend Elder Freda Smith Ministries, and to continue her writing to preserve the early history of LGBTQI Christians.

544,"Ziziphus cambodiana (, ang kroung) is a deciduous thorny shrub, or vine, some 2-6 m tall, found growing in secondary undergrowth in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam,
and northern Thailand.

Distribution
It occurs in Thailand in Sa Kaeo Province and in Chiang Mai Province.

Ecology
Moungsrimuangdee et al. include it as a riparian species in their study of the flora along the Phra Prong River in Watthana Nakhon District in Thailand, where it flowers in June. In mixed deciduous forest of Laos, the shrub becomes more common after logging, and to a lesser extent after shifting cultivation.
On the islands of the Mekong River between Kratié and Steung Treng in northern Cambodia the plant is moderately abundant. It grows as a ""wickedly spiny"" climber/liana in the prevalent bamboo and deciduous seasonal hardwood forest, and in degraded areas, secondary growth and deciduous dipterocarp forest. There it flowers in April and May, fruits from October to December, and has leaves between May and December. The fruits are harvested.

Uses
The wood is used to make charcoal in Cambodia, and a decoction of the bark is used in traditional medicine to treat ovarian diseases and yeast infections.

Villagers living on the plateau of Phnom Kulen National Park, in Svay Leu District, Siem Reap Province, northwestern Cambodia, use parts of the shrub in their traditional medicinal practices. The wood chips are decocted alone to treat stomach ache, they are also combined with the vine Willughbeia edulis and wood chips from Cananga latifolia in a decoction to treat stomach ache, circulation problems and/or to increase appetite. In order to help in pregnancy, a decoction of Z. cambodiana bark and a unidentified vine known as trolaing piən is drunk.

Among Kuy- and Khmer-speaking people living in the same villages in Stung Treng and Preah Vihear provinces of north-central Cambodia, the plant is also used as a source of medicine, as well as for unspecified other uses.

The Bunong people of Mondulkiri Province, northeastern Cambodia, have a number of traditional medicinal practices that involve the shrub. The fruits are eaten or are decocted and drunk alone or in a mixture with bark, root and wood of Cananga latifolia, whole plant of Hydnophytum formicarum, roots from various Leea species and Uraria crinita or U. lagopodiodes and bark of Vachellia harmandiana to treat stomach ache. To treat diarrhoea, a decoction of bark, fruit and wood of Z. cambodiana is drunk. The leaves and wood of this plant together with those of Taxillus chinensis are decocted and drunk to treat cough. Leucorrhoea is treated with a decocted mix of the bark and wood of Amphineurion marginatum, Cananga latifolia, Harrisonia perforata, Polyalthia cerasoides, Uvaria rufa, Z cambodiana, and Ziziphus oenoplia, the leaves and wood (?) of Hoya kerrii and roots of Leea species and Oroxylum indicum. A decoction of the roots of Z. cambodiana is drunk to treat food intolerance after having given birth.

In northern Thailand, the plant has been among those identified as being used by Karen people of Chiang Mai Province to treat gastric ulcers.

551,"The Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military () is an 18th-century Roman Catholic church in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. It is located on Rua Nova in the historic center of Recife and is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941.

History

The Recife Infantry Regiment (Terço da Vila de Santo Antônio do Recife), which included officers, sergeants and squares of the Corps of Execution and Cavalry, organized a Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military in the early 18th century. Under the command of João Lobo de Lacerda they requested permission to construct a church dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception on March 19, 1725. Some evidence dates to the beginning of construction of the church to 1710. It was completed in 1771.

Construction of the church was authorized by Antônio Fernandes de Matos. It features a simple, severe façade, in contrast to its richly decorated interior. The structures lacks a churchyard. It is constructed of heavy stonework, a single tower, and Rococo pediment. The interior walls are richly decorated with baroque carving.

The vault of the chancel is notably complex. It consists of a crossed arch with two side altars as typical of the period of King João V. The ceiling of the nave is a style associated with Nicolau Nasoni and André Soares, a sculptor, of northern Portugal. The length of the nave has a carved veranda; it is the only example of this type of construction in Recife. The ceiling of the name is richly painted with themes associated with the life of the Virgin Mary.

The paintings of the church depict elements atypical and possibly prohibited by the Church of the period, including homunculus of Jesus Christ on the breast of the Virgin Mary. A painting depicting the Battle of Guararapes is located in the lower choir. It was commissioned by Governor José César de Meneses, and attributed to João de Deus Sepúlveda. The central painting of the Virgin is attributed to José Rabelo Gonçalves.

The church remains under the management of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military.

Protected status

The Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941. The heritage designation includes both the church and the Summer Palace of the Archbishop. The structures were registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 4-T and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fl 53. Both directives are dated September 25, 1941.

Access

The church is open to the public and may be visited.

556,"The Great Alone is a historical fiction novel written by American author Kristin Hannah published by St. Martin's Press in 2018. The story follows the Allbright family's move to the Alaskan wilderness and the ensuing challenges they face there.

Development
The title The Great Alone is a reference to Robert W. Service's poem ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew"". Hannah cites her family, 1970s politics and Alaskan culture as inspirations for the novel. 

She had initially written a whole draft of a thriller with the same characters trying to solve a crime that had taken place in the past, but during revisions only kept the '70s Alaska setting; then started writing a first-person point-of-view novel from a teenage narrator.

Reception
The Great Alone spent four weeks at number one on The New York Times Fiction Best Seller list in 2018, and two weeks at number one on the Los Angeles Times hardcover fiction bestsellers list. It was 17th on USA Today's 2018 year-end top 100 best-selling books list. The novel won Best Historical Fiction at the 2018 Goodreads Choice Awards. As of 2021, the novel has sold two million copies in the United States.

The novel was featured in positive starred reviews by Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. The Toronto Star praised its ""compassionate, nuanced portrait of the “twisted love” that results from domestic violence, and of the ways in which women cope with such abuse."" The Star Tribune stated that the author ""has created an atmosphere of brooding paranoia and simmering violence that can set your heart racing. Anticipated plot twists unravel unexpectedly."" Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the novel, calling it ""a heart-tugger written in borderline young adult style, combining terrible troubles with notes of overripe romance."" Ron Charles of The Washington Post noted that ""the weaknesses of “The Great Alone” are usually camouflaged by its dramatic and often emotional plot.""

Adaptation
Before the book's publication, Variety announced Sony’s TriStar Pictures had preemptively purchased movie rights to The Great Alone, with Elizabeth Cantillon of the Cantillon Company and Laura Quicksilver as producers and Julia Cox as the screenwriter.

559,"Italian Brigands Surprised by Papal Troops is an 1831 painting produced in Rome by Horace Vernet. It is kept at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.

History
The painter Horace Vernet came to Italy in 1829, when he was already a well-known artist. He remained there until 1834 and worked as the director of the French Academy in Rome.

During his travels, he made around 20 paintings with the same colorful subjects and episodes of local life in the Roman countryside. They were works comparable to other painters who traveled Italy and mixed artistic classicism with research into color and local costumes. Vernet was considered a leader among these French painters, making him the juste milieu between the traditions of Romanticism and Neoclassicism.

The painting was recorded in the ""John T. Johnston Collection"", which was sold by its owner to William T. Walters of Baltimore on 20 December 1876 for $10,110, the most expensive work in Johnston's collection. In 1894, it passed to Henry Walters. In 1931, one of Walters' heirs left it to its current owner, the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. The painting underwent conservation treatments in 1938, 1969, 1981, and 1991.

Description
The painting depicts a battle along a road by the side of a cliff between a band of brigands surprised by a patrol of Papal dragoons. They had been robbing a carriage, which is visible in the background of the street in the painting. Beyond the carriage, a strip of sea is visible.

In the foreground, two brigands are in the combat against two cavalry soldiers. The first is being grabbed by the handkerchief around his neck is about to receive a pistol blow, after having wounded the soldier's horse with the dagger in his right hand. The second has grabbed the bridle of the other soldier's horse and is about to be struck by the soldier's saber. A third brigand flees while holding in his hands two bags stolen from travelers, abandoning a third in the road. A fourth brigand fires a rifle at the soldiers, covering his companion's flight. Two women, depicted in typical local costumes, despair and implore in front of a small religious chapel at the side of the road.

Further back on the right side of the painting, other brigands stand along the slope of the hill, some fleeing and pulling with them a feminine figure in a long blue dress—probably a passenger of the captured carriage. Others stand behind boulders, looking at the scene below. Along the road, a third cavalry soldier and some on foot fire at the fleeing brigands with rifles. The carriage in the background is empty, and a person and horse lie dead on the ground near its wheels.

Style
The scene is realized in dramatic tones, following academic visual traditions with particular attention to the details of shades of color. The rocks in the background and the grey clouds in the sky magnify the drama of the action illuminated by the sun. The attention to the military subjects and the cavalry comes from the pictoral interest of Vernet's father, Carle Vernet. The unlikely palm tree depicted behind the chapel, amid the wild vegetation, add a touch of exoticism to the painting. Vernet made many paintings with Orientalist themes.

Critics have observed how the scene represents a single moment of action: the hat of the cavalry soldier in the foreground has not yet fallen to the ground, and the brigand is lifted from the ground as the soldier is about to shoot him. All the painting's details are meticulously painting, giving it the feeling of a ""a pre-photographic, photographic painting"".

The fountain of water in the foreground recalls a classical sarcophagus, a common feature in the neoclassical themes of the French school in Rome at that time.

Genre
Brigands that lived in the Roman countryside, despite being a serious menace to travelers, were a preferred Romantic figure of numerous Roman painters and artists of the time, like Bartolomeo Pinelli, Louis Léopold Robert,  Léon Cogniet, and Luigi Rocco. They took up the same themes as the Roman Bamboccianti painters and mixed them with Neo-classical influences.

Vernet, probably due to the success of those works, began to compose paintings on the topic in 1820 with his Route de Naples, which represented a group of bandits ready for an ambush and hiding behind a group of boulders near a seaside road by Terracina. The success of the painting was immediate and was reproduced as a lithography by Francois Saeraphin Delpech.

After Italian Brigands Surprised by Papal Troops, Vernet made a third painting on the subject of brigands, Confession of an Italian Bandit, in 1834. It was destroyed in the sacking of the castle at Neuilly during the Revolutions of 1848. The painting, which was reproduced several times, showed a dying bandit lying on an ox-driven cart receiving absolution by a monk kneeling by his side. The background landscape largely depicts neo-classical motifs like temple ruins and the arches of a Roman aqueduct. The capture of the repentance of the bandit and his absolution closes Vernet's trilogy of brigand paintings (that is, Route de Naples, Italian Brigands Surprised by Papal Troops, and Confession of an Italian Bandit).

Also in the theme, Vernet painted The Bandit Betrayed in 1828, a scene of a brigand being captured by soldiers thanks to the betrayal of a woman with whom he had made an appointment. Again, it was a painting that mixed realism with a dramatic scene depicting a single, instantaneous moment.

Reproductions
Italian Brigands Surprised by Papal Troops was copied by Vernet's students and reproduced by Henry Dowe and David Lucas in two large aquatints.

560,"John Saville Zamet FDS (11 November 1932 - 5 May 2007) was a periodontist in the United Kingdom. He established the first exclusively periodontal practice in London in 1966.

After he retired, he attended the University College Hospital and took a course in Holocaust studies, leading him to write the biographies of refugee dental surgeons in the UK, and assess their skills as a missed opportunity for improving the ordinary quality of interwar British dental surgery. He died shortly after completing his PhD thesis on German and Austrian Refugee Dentists 1933–1945, The Response of The British Authorities in 2007. His PhD degree was awarded posthumously and his thesis remains unpublished.

Early life and career
John Zamet was born in London on 11 November 1932.

In 1958, three years after completing his studies in dentistry at the Royal Dental Hospital (RDH), he obtained his fellowship in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

With an interest in periodontology, between 1956 and 1962, he worked in the departments at the Eastman Dental Hospital, Guy's Hospital and the RDH. At the time the subject was still in its infancy in the UK. Although in the US the speciality was long established, the first British academic department was only set up in 1948 at the Eastman Dental Hospital, under W. G. Cross.

He went to America in 1962 on a post-graduate fellowship to study at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Periodontics. There he came under the influence of periodontologist D. Walter Cohen.

Return to London and senior posts
On his return to the UK, Zamet was appointed senior lecturer at the RDH, and later consultant in periodontology at University College Hospital (UCH) Dental School. After the closure of the UCH school Zamet moved to the Eastman as honorary consultant in periodontology. He stayed there until he retired in 2001.

Whilst at UCH and the Eastman, Zamet carried out several research projects. In 1974 he was awarded an MPhil degree by the University of London for his dissertation, A Comparative Clinical Study of Three Periodontal Surgical techniques, which examined clinical outcomes of surgical periodontal therapy. Other research was carried out into particulate bioglass grafts.

In 1966, Zamet established the first, and for many years the only, singularly periodontal practice in London. He was also the first UK periodontist to participate in the Bränemark Osseointegration Programme in Göthenberg. This programme stemmed from when, in 1952 Per-Ingvar Brånemark put titanium-encased optical devices into the legs of rabbits to study the healing process. At the end of the research period, after removing the devices, they discovered unexpectedly that the titanium had fused into the bone and could not be removed. He called the process osseointegration. The toleration to long-term presence of titanium led to the potential for new research in using it to create an anchor for artificial teeth.

Zamet pursued recognition for periodontology as a UK speciality and played an influential role in the establishment of the General Dental Council's Specialist Register in Periodontology.

Other roles

Societies
He took up responsibilities in numerous societies, including President, Honorary Vice-President and Honorary Life Member of the British Society of Periodontology, a Life Member of the American Academy of Periodontology and an Honorary Member of the American Dental Society of London.

Alpha Omega International Dental Fraternity
At a time when Jewish students were not allowed to form social groups, a group of Jewish dental students founded The Alpha Omega International Dental Fraternity in 1907 at the University of Maryland School of Dental Medicine, which claims to be the oldest international dental organisation and the oldest international Jewish medical organisation. It eventually incorporated over 100 alumni and student chapters in ten countries.

Zamet became the first and twenty-fifth chairman of the London chapter of the Alpha Omega Dental Fraternity, which sponsored numerous projects in the UK and Israel. He also served as secretary of its London Charitable Trust.

At one time, he liaised with Walter Annenberg and obtained funding for postgraduate education and the Annenberg Lecture and Traveling Scholarship.

Retirement and Holocaust studies
Zamet retired in 2001, following which he enrolled at University College London in Holocaust studies, where he was a student of Michael Berkowitz. After completing an MA, he furthered his studies by working on a PhD thesis on German and Austrian Refugee Dentists 1933–1945, The Response of The British Authorities. In the 1930s and 1940s, displaced doctors searched the world for locations where their skills might be appreciated and where they could find a place of safety from worsening Nazi persecution. As part of his thesis, in 2005, Zamet wrote to the British Dental Journal as he attempted to ""reconstruct the history of this brave group of professionals, who despite the odds, succeeded in a foreign country which did not want them"".

He recreated the biographies of refugee dental surgeons, and assessed their qualifications and skills as a missed opportunity for improving the quantity and quality of interwar British dental surgery. As a result, he established many contacts with surviving refugees and their families, assembling a unique compilation of sources. His research has been described by  medical historian Paul Weindling as ""outstanding"" and ""exceptional"". Zamet compared dental training at the University of Vienna with that in Britain in the 1930s, concluding that the ""dilapidated state of British dental health and dentistry"" at that time was a ""cottage industry"". Despite demonstrating a British need for them, of the 360 Viennese dental surgeons (stomatologists) that applied to the General Medical Council (GMC) to register on the Dental Register, there being no General Dental Council until 1956, only 41 were granted registration, and only after re-certification. Many of those disallowed registration and therefore denied entry to the UK, ""despite their excellent training, probably died during the Holocaust"" or were led to suicide.

Death and legacy
Weindling attributes the loss of records and lack of archival material on migrant practitioners in general to the delay in ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"", that is, the coming to terms with the past. He consequently relates Zamet as a ""pioneer"" in this field and a historian of refugee dental surgeons, while other medical professionals have yet to find their historian.

Zamet completed his PhD thesis in December 2006. He died on 5 May 2007, and his PhD degree was awarded posthumously in 2007.

In acknowledgement of his contributions to periodontology, in 2011 the London Chapter and Charitable Trust established a John Zamet Memorial Prize in Periodontal Research open to UK-based postgraduate dental students studying for a master's degree or PhD who are undertaking or who have recently completed original research associated with clinical periodontology. It is awarded every second year.

571,"Out of the Mist is an album by saxophonist Joseph Jarman and violinist Leroy Jenkins, which was recorded in 1997 and released on the Ocean label. Jarman, Jenkins, and pianist Myra Melford would go on to form the collaborative trio Equal Interest.

Reception

In his review for AllMusic,  John Young states "" Joseph Jarman's tenor saxophone and Leroy Jenkins' violin are better known from two important jazz outfits, respectively, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Revolutionary Ensemble. This time, Jarman's other axes include ceramic flutes, bass flute, ""hands"" (sic), some rather useless chimes and gongs, and the mysterious Isan. Jenkins swaps his violin for a harmonica on a few cuts, as well as playing kalimba, but that violin makes a great foil for the rather stiff timbre of Jarman's ceramic flutes. And a little stiffness proves to be a virtue this time ... There's a ceremonial feel to the playing; a stateliness that focuses the improvisations as surely as a handy stopwatch, cordiality co-exists with chaos"".

A Billboard reviewer commented: ""The avant-garde proves to be alive and well as genre giants meet... This progressive session creates memorable atmospheres of acoustic tones plucked, blown, and beaten in a kind of world-jazz blend influenced by not only African and East Asian styles but also by European modern classical music.""

574,"Bye Bye Patty is the first live album by Italian singer Patty Pravo, released in 1997 by Epic Records.

Overview
The material was recorded live between 16 and 24 January 1997 during concerts in Bergamo, Milan, Florence and Rome. It consists of sixteen songs, most of which come from the earliest years of Pravo's career. The only studio recording is the opening track ""...E dimmi che non vuoi morire"" which Patty performed at the 47th Sanremo Music Festival in February 1997 and won the critics' award. The song was released as the first single and met with commercial success. A new, rock-influenced version of ""Pensiero stupendo"" was performed as an encore, followed by nearly two minutes of silence and a secret recording in which a little girl named Federica sings the chorus of ""...E dimmi che non vuoi morire"". ""Pensiero stupendo '97"" was released as the second single from the album.

Bye Bye Patty was a top 5 chart hit in Italy on the back of Patty's acclaimed Sanremo performance. It has reportedly sold 250,000 copies by October 1997. A video version of the album was released later that year on VHS and DVD, titled Bye Bye Patty – Patty Pravo Live al Piper. It consists of live footage from the show at the Piper Club in Rome.

578,"Proto-Totonacan or Proto-Totonac-Tepehua (abbreviated PTn or PTT) is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Totonacan languages of Mexico. It was first reconstructed using comparative methods in 1953 by Evangelina Arana Osnaya. Some linguists have proposed a link between the Totonacan and Mixe–Zoque language families; therefore making Proto-Totonacan a sister language of Proto-Mixe–Zoque and descendant of Proto-Totozoquean.

Phonology

Consonants

 Notes
 MacKay and Trechsel (2018) add ejective stops and affricates.
 Davletshin (2008) and Brown et al. (2011) add /ʔ/ and /h/. MacKay and Trechsel (2018) accept /ʔ/ but reject /h/.

Vowels

 Notes
 Brown et al. (2011) accept this vowel inventory. 
 MacKay and Trechsel (2018) reject laryngealized vowels in Proto-Totonacan. They argue that laryngealized vowels in the Totonac languages  are too infrequent and erratic after fricatives and sonorants to support their reconstruction.

Lexicon
The following Proto-Totonac-Tepehua reconstructions are from MacKay and Trechsel (2018).

582,"Mary Max (née Balkin; October 20, 1966 – June 9, 2019) was an American animal rights activist and wife of German-American pop artist Peter Max. She was a member of the board of directors of the Humane Society of the United States from 2005 until her death of apparent suicide in June 2019.

VegNews, a magazine that promotes veganism, remembered her ""tireless work [as a] relentless ambassador of animal rights.""

Early life and education
Max was born on October 20, 1966 in Buffalo, New York to Ruth K. Balkin. She graduated from Nardin Academy, a private college-preparatory school, and attended Canisius College.

Animal rights activism
Max became active in the animal rights movement after a conversation with Italian actress Isabella Rosellini, who told her about factory farming. By her death in June 2019, Max had become a well-known figure among animal activists in New York. For years, she wrote and distributed action alert emails that encouraged her readers to contact legislators about animal-friendly bills. She also hosted various fundraisers at her husband's studio to support legislators and politicians, including New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, and donated artwork and her personal jewelry for auctions that benefited animal rights. 

In 2001, she helped organize the Farm Sanctuary's first gala and later joined the organization's advisory council.

She was a founding member of the board of directors for the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food, an organization that introduces plant-based foods and nutrition education to school communities, and joined the board of directors of the Humane Society of the United States. In 2005, Max co-founded Humane USA-PAC, a political action committee that promotes animal rights legislators in the United States. She then helped to launch Voters for Animal Rights to promote animal rights legislators in the state of New York.

In 2011, Max executive produced Vegucated, an American documentary film that explores the challenges of converting to a veganism diet.

Personal life
In 1996, she met renowned painter Peter Max, and the two married in 1997. Their wedding was officiated by New York City's then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.

She was a vegan.

590,"A bago is a traditional boat built by the Mandar people of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The hull is of the pajala-type, lightly built and allowing for shallow displacement. The boat is long, with the mast only making up a quarter of its length. A bago can be readily identified as Mandarese boat by its rudderpost style. Smaller-sized bagos are often used as fishing boats from which fishermen cast their nets. The Mandar people prefer using a bago over an outrigger canoe.

In the present, small bagos are outfitted with a leti (lete) sail/rig, but not long ago, they had canted rectangular sails (tanja rig). Bigger versions of the bago, also using the pajala-type hull, are sometimes built rather deep and round but without the angle at the end of the keel. These boats can be found all over Mandar coast. A type with nade sail, created the West Sulawesian lambo. Another type, with leti sail and Mandar-style flat-roofed deckhouse, may be mistaken as leti leti. There is not much difference between the two except in the pattern of the placement of the planks and other details that give the characteristics of each manufacturing place of the boat.

He had contacts with various right-wing extremist groups and ran in 1976 as a candidate for the right-wing Hochschulring Tübingen students (HTS) for the General Student Committee of the University of Tübingen. In HTS there was at least one other member of Werhsportgruppe Hoffmann, the Munich Oktoberfest bomber Gundolf Köhler. In June 1976, Behrendt was elected to the University Political Committee (HpA) of the German Burschenschaft.

On December 19, 1980 Behrendt shot and killed Shlomo Lewin and his domestic partner Frieda Poeschke in front of their house in Erlangen with a Beretta sub-machine gun. Lewin had written several critical reports on the ""Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann. According to a statement by Hoffmann,  Behrendt confessed to him that he had committed the killings. Hoffmann helped Behrendt to cover his tracks by burning some of his clothes. At the time of the crime, Behrendt lived at Schloss Ermreuth, Hoffmann's private residence.

After the murder, Behrendt fled West Germany on December 23, 1980 and stayed until 25 December 1980 in Pößneck in East Germany on a pretended Christmas visit to his parents. Thereafter, he is said to have returned to West Germany and from there he made his way to Damascus in Syria and later to Beirut in Lebanon. There WSG Hoffmann established (with Fatah's support) an organisation, called ""WSG Ausland"". In Lebanon, Behrendt allegedly tortured and mistreated other members of the WGS Hoffmann. One of the members, Kay-Uwe Bergmann, disappeared without a trace. Behrendt committed suicide on 16 September 1981 in a Lebanese military camp Karl-Heinz Hoffmann was convicted for having participated in the torture of  Kay-Uwe Bergmann.

In 2017 the Federal Prosecutor's Office started new investigations into the so called ""Lebanon complex"". The skull and a few bone fragments belonging to Behrendt were found on the grounds of the camp in Lebanon.

602,"If Only for One Night is a live album by trumpeter/composer Wallace Roney which was recorded at the Iridium in New York City in 2009 and released on the HighNote label the following year.

Reception

Allmusic's Michael G. Nastos said ""Retro-fusion and funk à la latter period Miles Davis with hard-swinging jazz and some pop-type ballads comprise this meaty and beaty session full of energetic highs and introspective low-key music. ... A diverse and enjoyable set, overdue for Roney in a club or concert setting, it shows he's a strong player with plenty of ideas in the tank based in tribute to his idol Davis"". Financial Times reviewer, Mike Hobart, stated ""Roney is a forceful and atmospheric trumpeter, stretching out in sympathetic company, his rounded tone perfectly captured by this live club recording"". In The Guardian, John Fordham noted ""Plenty of trumpeters play Miles's notes, and get close to his sound – but Roney goes deeper, because he also shares the uncanny timing and dramatic instincts, and the vision to conceive a moment-to-moment improvised solo as a narrative whole"". PopMatters', Will Layman wrote: ""Throughout this set, the band is inventive and powerful, even if they seem to be searching for a clear identity. In being able to play anything (at least anything Davis-inspired), the band loses itself a bit. Roney seems most himself on the final track, a solo trumpet essay for his son, where he sheds the Miles sound somewhat and hints at his classical studies"".

608,"Charles Arthur Pharmer (July 21, 1908 – February 1, 1970) was an American football player who played at the halfback and fullback positions. He played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers from 1927 to 1929. He also played in the National Football League (NFL) for the 1930 Minneapolis Red Jackets and the 1930 and 1931 Frankford Yellow Jackets.

Early years and college
Pharmer was born in Spokane, Washington, in 1908. He attended Gonzaga High School. He was captain of the Gonzaga High football team in 1925.

He played college football for Minnesota from 1926 to 1929. On October 27, 1929, he scored 22 points in a victory over Ripon. He tied for the Big Ten Conference scoring title during the 1929 season. 

In early 1930, he also played basketball on an independent barnstorming team organized by his University of Minnesota teammate, Bronko Nagurski.

Professional football

Minneapolis Red Jackets
In September 1930, Pharmer joined the Minneapolis Red Jackets of the NFL. He appeared in a total of eight games for the Red Jackets, five of them as a starter. On September 21, he kicked five extra points in the Red Jacket's season opener against the Northland Oils. On October 12, as the team's starting halfback, he intercepted two passes in 13–0 victory over the Portsmouth Panthers.

Frankford Yellow Jackets

During two seasons in the NFL, Pharmer appeared in a total of 15 games, 12 as a starter.

Minor league football
After his NFL career ended, Pharmer continued to play for minor league teams. During the 1931 season, he played for the Clifton Heights Orange & Black.

In 1933, he played for the Albany Knickerbockers of Albany, New York. He returned to Minnesota in 1934, playing for the University of Minnesota All Stars and Ken Haycraft's St. Paul All Stars.

Career

Mr Speakers's first race was on August 24, 2013, at Saratoga, where he came in 6th. He picked up his first win, after 3 races, on October 14, 2013, at Belmont Park.

On December 21, 2013, he picked up his first stakes win at the Grade-3 Dania Beach Stakes. He came into the race at 10:1 odds and defeated Cabo Cat for the victory. He finished out the 2013 season with this win.

To start the 2014 season, he came in a disappointing 7th at the Grade-2 Holy Bull Stakes and came in 2nd at the Grade-3 Palm Beach Stakes.

He picked up his first win of the 2014 season, when he won the Grade-3 Lexington Stakes on April 19, 2014. He defeated Divine Oath by four lengths at 2:1 odds as the favorite.

On May 26, 2014, he came in a disappointing 5th place finish at the Penning Ridge Stakes. This loss was overshadowed though as on July 5, 2014, he won the Grade-1 Belmont Derby. He came into the race at 23:1 odds, the second to worst odds in the field. The win gained his owners a $1,250,000 million dollar purse after he edged Adelaide near the finish.

The Belmont Derby win ended up being his last win for over one year as he did not see victory again until he won a much less impressive Allowance Optional Claiming race at Woodbine on July 15, 2015.

He came in 4th at the August 16th, 2015, Grade-2 Sky Classic Stakes and grabbed the final win of his career on September 19th, 2015, at the Commonwealth Turf Cup. He defeated Cut to Order and Legendary as the race favorite at 2:1 odds.

He finished his career on November 14, 2015, after a 5th place finish at the Red Smith Stakes. He was officially retired in late November 2015.

611,"On August 28, 1957, Strom Thurmond, a United States Senator from South Carolina, began a filibuster intended to stop the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. It began at 8:54p.m. and lasted until 9:12p.m. the following day, for a total length of 24 hours and 18 minutes. This made the filibuster the longest single-person filibuster in United States Senate history, a record that still stands . The content of the filibuster focused primarily on asserting that the bill was both unnecessary and unconstitutional, with Thurmond reading from a number of laws and other legal documents. While the filibuster was supported by many South Carolinians and citizens of other southern states, Thurmond's decision to filibuster the bill went against a previous agreement among Southern senators. As a result, Thurmond received mixed praise and criticism for his speech. His filibuster is widely seen as racist today, as the civil rights bill he opposed protected voting rights for African-Americans. Despite the filibuster, the bill passed less than two hours after Thurmond's conclusion of the speech.

Background and goals
The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was designed to federally secure and protect the right of African-Americans to vote. While the Fifteenth Amendment had federally guaranteed men of all races the right to vote in 1870, state laws, poll taxes, and other institutions prevented African-Americans from voting. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 aimed to protect African-Americans' voting rights by establishing a Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice and a U.S. Civil Rights Commission, among other things. In the Senate, the bill was supported by both Republicans and Democrats, though most Democrats from southern states opposed the bill. Thurmond saw the bill as a direct attack on states' rights. South Carolina's Governor George Bell Timmerman urged citizens to pressure their senators to filibuster, stating that if Southern senators did not filibuster they would be responsible for ""compromising the inalienable rights of the American people.""

Thurmond was a fairly well-known figure in American politics prior to his senatorship: He was elected as governor of South Carolina in 1946, helped to found the States' Rights Democratic Party after a walkout over civil rights at the 1948 Democratic National Convention, and ran against Harry S. Truman and Thomas E. Dewey as the new party's candidate in the 1948 presidential election. Thurmond garnered more than one million votes and won four states in this third-party presidential bid. Six years later in 1954, Thurmond ran as a Democrat and was elected to the Senate in a write-in campaign as the junior senator from South Carolina. Thurmond's political candidacies were largely based on his opposition to racial integration.

An agreement among the Southern senators to not stage an organized filibuster had been reached in Georgia Senator Richard Russell's office four days prior to Thurmond's speech. Thurmond's departure from the senators' agreement was later criticized by party leaders including Russell and Herman Talmadge.

Filibuster

Thurmond claimed that the civil rights bill constituted a ""cruel and unusual punishment"", and stated that he hoped to ""educate the country"" by means of an extended speech against the legislation. He was primarily focused on a provision in the bill that would allow minor voting rights contempt cases to be tried by a judge without a jury present, but that allowed a second trial by jury for penalties in the first trial greater than 45 days' imprisonment or a $300 fine. Thurmond and other Southern senators saw this as a violation of the defendant's right to a trial by jury, which is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

The filibuster began at 8:54p.m. on August 28, 1957 with a reading of the election laws of each of the 48 states in alphabetical order and continued with readings of U.S. Supreme Court rulings, Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville, and George Washington's Farewell Address. The Senate chamber gallery, filled with hundreds of spectators at the beginning of the filibuster, dwindled to just NAACP lobbyist Clarence Mitchell Jr. and Thurmond's wife Jean at points during the early morning hours. On the morning of the 29th, Thurmond's voice dropped to a mumble and his tone became increasingly monotonous. Republican leader William Knowland from California requested around midday that Thurmond speak up so he could be sure no motions were being made, but Thurmond responded by suggesting that the senator move closer. Knowland remained where he was. At approximately 1p.m. Thurmond yielded to allow for William Proxmire, who was elected following the death of Joseph McCarthy, to be sworn in. Thurmond was also allowed breaks throughout the day by other senators, including some in support of the bill, when they questioned him at length.

Thurmond concluded his filibuster after 24 hours and 18 minutes at 9:12p.m. on August 29, making it the longest filibuster ever conducted in the Senate . He was congratulated by Wayne Morse, the previous record holder, who spoke against the Submerged Lands Act for 22 hours and 26 minutes in 1953. Consuming 96 pages in the Congressional Record, Thurmond's filibuster cost taxpayers over $7,000 in printing costs ($ in   dollars).

Logistics
Thurmond's filibuster has been described by biographer Joseph Crespino as ""kind of a urological mystery"". Thurmond claimed to have taken daily steam baths leading up to the filibuster in order to draw fluids out of his body, thus dehydrating himself and allowing himself to absorb fluids for a longer period of time during the filibuster. It has also been rumored within the African-American community that Thurmond used other methods to avoid leaving for the restroom. The Chicago Defender stated that Thurmond had worn ""a contraption devised for long motoring trips"" that allowed him to relieve himself on the stand, and longtime Capitol Hill staffer Bertie Bowman claimed in his memoir that Thurmond had been fitter with a catheter. Thurmond was allowed to leave the stand only once, approximately three hours into his filibuster. Senator Barry Goldwater quietly asked Thurmond how much longer he could hold off using the restroom, to which he replied, ""about another hour"". Goldwater asked Thurmond to yield the floor to him for a few minutes, and Thurmond was able to use the restroom while Goldwater spoke. An aide had prepared a bucket in the Senate cloakroom for Thurmond to relieve himself if the need arose, but Thurmond did not end up using it. Thurmond's health had become an item of concern by the evening of the 29th among his aides and the Senate doctor, who specifically requested that Thurmond end his filibuster out of consideration for his wellbeing.

During the filibuster, Thurmond sustained himself on diced pieces of pumpernickel bread and small pieces of cooked hamburger. He also sucked on throat lozenges and malted milk tablets to keep himself from getting hoarse. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois brought Thurmond a pitcher of orange juice as noon approached on the 29th, but a staffer quickly put it out of his reach after Thurmond had drunk a glass.

Outcome and reception

The filibuster failed to prevent the passage of the bill, and further failed to change the vote whatsoever. The bill passed two hours after Thurmond finished speaking, and was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower less than two weeks later. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first U.S. civil rights bill passed in 82 years.

While the filibuster did not use any ""overtly racist language"" according to The Washington Post, it has been described both contemporaneously and in modern sources as such because the bill Thurmond filibustered against protected the right of African-Americans to vote. According to Joseph Crespino, the filibuster, as well as his partial authorship of the Southern Manifesto the preceding year, ""sealed Thurmond's reputation as one of the South's last Confederates, a champion of white southerners' campaign of 'massive resistance to civil rights. He further states that the filibuster was a way for Thurmond to uphold Southern ideas about white strength and endurance while also burnishing his personal image of masculinity and health.

Thurmond received significant criticism, even from Democrats including Talmadge, Russell, and the Southern Caucus as a whole. Talmadge referred to the speech as a form of grandstanding, and Russell denounced it as ""personal political aggrandizement."" These senators had received numerous telegrams during Thurmond's speech encouraging them to assist Thurmond in his filibuster by relieving him, while Thurmond's staff received correspondence from hundreds of southerners congratulating and encouraging him. Most Southern Democratic senators opposed the filibuster, despite its popularity among their constituents, because (as Richard Russell put it) the South had already secured a compromise in the bill which would be jeopardized by a filibuster and there was not enough support to prevent a cloture vote anyway.

In 1964, Thurmond (who would switch his affiliation to the Republican Party later that year) participated in a second anti-civil rights filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1964 filibuster was carried out by a group of Southern senators over 60 days and was only ended by a cloture vote. Thurmond was repeatedly elected and served in the Senate for 48 years, making him the oldest and longest-serving senator ever at the time of his retirement.

612,"The Cayman nesophontes (Nespohontes hemicingulus) is an extinct eulipotyphlan of the genus Nesophontes that was once endemic to the Cayman Islands (Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac); the animal lived in the island montane forest/brush endemic to the Cayman Islands and was an insectivore. It is known from subfossil remains, that bear bite marks attributed to crocodiles, collected from caves, sinkholes and peat deposits on the Islands between the 1930s and the 1990s. It was named in 2019.

Extinction
It is believed that the animal was never observed by Europeans. Contemporary fossils with indigenous artifacts and introduced rat fossils indicate survival into the colonial era, possibly until the 16th century. It disappeared after introduction of rats (starting from May 10, 1503, AD with the arrival of Christopher Columbus at the Cayman Islands) and due to the destruction of its forest habitat, although this species may have survived until around 1774 AD. Using analysis of existing and new radiometric dates (of which the existing dates mainly point towards an extinction date of pre-1600 AD for the Nesophontes genus as a whole), an estimated extinction date of 1700 AD (95% confidence interval = 1632–1774 AD) was estimated for N. hemicingulus in 2019.

617,"The  was an irrigation canal dating the from Heian period, the remnants of which are located in what is now the cities of Maebashi, and Isesaki Gunma Prefecture in the northern Kantō region of Japan. The six surviving disconnected portions were collectively designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1983.

Overview
The Onna-bori extends from an elevation of 100 meters on Mount Akagi for some thirteen kilometers east to west, and with a width of between 15 and 30 meters and a depth of three to four meters.

The origins of the Onna-bori are uncertain. According to legend, it was made by a woman using her kanzashi hairpin in one night. Other legends attribute it to the semi-legendary Empress Suiko or to the Kamakura period Hōjō Masako. Per another theory, the kanji of its name are a corruption of ""媼堀"", meaning literally ""useless ditch"" alluding to the fact that it was never completed. In 1979, archaeological evidence indicates that a portion of the canal was dug through a layer of soil which had been created by the 1108 eruption of Mount Asama, placing the date of its construction to sometime in the 12th century. There were a number of large shōen estates between Mount Akai and the Tone River in Kōzuke Province during this period; however, with the rise mutually antagonistic landlords during the Muromachi period, the canal was never completed, and eventually many portion were destroyed or were diverted for other uses.

622,"Dmitry Evgenievich Kolezev () is a Russian journalist from the region called Urals who is known internationally for working at independent online mass media, dedicated primarily to life in this region, and is particularly known for criticizing Russian authorities. His current position is the head of the online magazine It's My City dedicated to Ekaterinburg city, which is considered informal ""capital of Urals"", and previously Kolezev was known as leading journalist at popular news websites Znak.com and Ura.ru also based there.

Biography 
Dmitry Kolezev was born in Kamensk-Uralsky, graduated from School №9 in Ekaterinburg and later from Faculty of Journalism of Ural State University. Upon graduation, he worked at Uralpolit.ru, a news website currently belonging to FederalPress media holding, later at popular 2006-founded Ura.ru news website and subsequently at popular Znak.com news website which he co-founded and developed for 8 years. All these websites focus on events in Ural region and its surroundings: mainly this is related to territories included in Ural Federal District, but there may also be content from the neighboring Perm Krai and also from Moscow, Saint Petersburg and the rest of Russia, as the websites are considered to develop country-wide notability.

While working at Ura.ru, he was a leading columnist along with another leading one, Mikhail Vyugin. On 29 November 2012, the journalistic collective got split up, as Vyugin declared overtake of Ura.ru in his favor on political and economical grounds following scandals related to actions of Ura.ru's founder Aksana Panova. She was suspected in fraud related to coverage of local political events and illegal financial operations, was found guilty by court and was temporarily banned by court from journalistic activities.

Following the split, Panova and Kolezev co-created new Znak.com website in 2012 to continue their journalistic work and are considered to be successful, while Ura.ru also continued to work as intended. While Panova was under court trial, Kolezev acted as one of the main witnesses there, and factually ruled Znak.com when she couldn't. The trial was intensely covered by Russian and worldwide press. In 2019, a survey by Medialogia agency found that Ura.ru was the 1st most cited news source in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Znak.com was the 2nd one among the total of 25.

Worldwide mass media regularly cite Dmirty Kolezev as a source of local opinions on events happening in the Urals and Russia. These include: The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBC, The Times, The Guardian and others.

In 2020, Kolezev declared that he was separating from Znak.com to rule solely the It's My City project as an independent mass media while previously it was a ""society column"" section within Znak.com. Kolezev is considered a local ""celebrity"" and maintains popular personal information channels such as Telegram, YouTube and Twitter channels, Facebook, LiveJournal and other pages, watched by thousands of subscribers.

Member of the jury of the Russian journalistic award called Redkollegia.

In June 2021 he was appointed Chief Editor of the news website called Republic based in Moscow, without leaving It's My City.

636,"Hikurangi Marine Reserve is a marine reserve off the coast of the Kaikoura District, in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand's South Island. It is the largest and deepest marine reserve in New Zealand.

The reserve is covers an area of  10,416 hectares south of the township of Kaikōura. It includes part of the Kaikōura Canyon, a 1000 metre deep side branch of the Hikurangi Trench. It includes a rocky coastline of greywacke boulder and bedrock reefs. Panau Island and two smaller islets are located offshore.

The marine reserve is only available for limited passive recreation. No fishing, harvesting or mining is allowed. However, whales, dolphins and sea birds can be viewed in large numbers.

History

The park was established in 2014.

In November 2016, the Kaikoura earthquake caused submarine mudslides and sediment flows that devastated the deep-sea life in the canyon. Road access to the coast was also affected.

In September 2017, a National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research expedition found species were recovering faster than expected.

A subsidiary of Talley's Group was convicted and fined for trawling in the marine reserve in March 2019. The company denied the charge, and Talley's denied responsibility.

Wildlife

The depth of the canyon makes it a food basket for whale, dolphin and sea bird species. Several small rivers and streams provide nutrients from nearby mountains. Cold water from the Southland Current from the Southern Ocean and warm water from the East Cape Current from the subtropics also converge to create a nutrient-rich environment.

The Kaikoura Canyon is the only place where the sperm whale can be viewed closed to the New Zealand mainland. There are significant colonies of New Zealand fur seals, large pods of dusky dolphins and small groups of Hector's dolphins.

Orca regularly visit the area and humpback whales pass through during their northern winter migration. Many other species of whales, albatross, petrel, shearwater and prion also gather in the area regularly.

The coast is the only breeding ground in the world for Hutton's shearwater.

Encrusting and mobile invertebrates like molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, anemones and sponges are common on the reefs. Macro-invertebrates like paua, kina and rock lobster also live around the reefs. Seaweed is common close to shore.

Fish species along the coast include butterfish, blue cod, tarakihi, marblefish, blue moki, red moki, sea perch, wrasse and triplefin. Fish in the deeper waters include rattails, hapuku, tarakihi, ling, hoki, lantern fish, sharks, rays, skates and squid.

The depth of the reserve makes it difficult to survey for wildlife, and very little is known about the deepest areas of the canyon.

637,"Population cleansing is the deliberate removal of a population with certain undesirable characteristics, such as its ethnicity (ethnic cleansing), its religion (religious cleansing), its social group (social cleansing), its social class, its ideological or political criteria (political cleansing), etc. from certain territories.

Throughout antiquity, population cleansing was largely motivated by economic and political factors, although ethnic factors occasionally played a role. Andrew Bell-Fialkoff attributes the earliest known example of cleansing as a state policy to Assyria. Assurnasirpal II and Assurbanipal resettled millions of people from the conquered territories in order to crush the resistance. Usually upper classes were resettled, rather than complete populations, because peasant and artisan masses usually lacked leadership to initiate revolts. He further gives a number of other cases in Chapter 1 ""Cleansing: A Historical Overview"" of his book. While discussing the case of Ancient Greece, Bell-Fialkoff singles out a special type of the elimination of a conquered polis, for which the Greeks had a special term: andrapodismos (from the word ἀνδράποδον, one taken in war and sold as a slave). 
Andrapodismos involved the destruction of a polis, killing all male adults and selling women and children into slavery. Other kinds of the elimination of a polis (with or without its destruction) involved removal of its whole population to another polis,  dispersing over villages, or emigration of its population, possibly founding a polis elsewhere.

Since ancient times, methods of cleansing varied from killing (democide, genocide) to forced population transfer, to forced emigration.

643,"Parenting law in Australia encompasses a number of areas of law including:

 Parenting arrangements under the Family Law Act - previously referred to as ""child custody"" laws;
 Child Protection laws, where State Governments have powers to protect children;
 Parentage (who is the legal parent of a child). 
In Australia, a child is a person under 18 years old. The majority of the legislation about parenting in Australia does not apply once a child reaches the age of 18.

Parenting law under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) 
Part VII of the Family Law Act provides power for certain courts to make orders about the parenting of children. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia manages the majority of this work, but in some cases it is conducted by state courts (particularly in regional areas). In Western Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia has jurisdiction over almost all parenting issues.

The Family Law Act applies to the children of married and unmarried parents. The majority of parenting matters falling under the Family Law Act involve separated parents, but the jurisdiction can apply to children of intact relationships (for example, an application may be made by a grandparent to spend time with a child of a married couple.

Part VII has been amended significantly in 1995, 2006, and 2011.

""Best interests"" test 
Best interests or best interests of the child is a child rights principle, which derives from Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which says that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.

The best interests of the child in question must be the ""paramount consideration"" when a court makes a parenting order under the Family Law Act. To determine the best interests of a child the court must take into account the two primary considerations (the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents and the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm) and a number of additional considerations (such as the views of the child and the capacity of the child's parents to provide for their needs).

Parental responsibility 
Parental responsibility means all of the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that parents have in relation to children. Each parent automatically has parental responsibility for their children, unless amended by court order.

Joint parental responsibility 
If there are no orders in place, each parent can, in theory, independently make decisions about the care of the child. In practice, parents are usually required to make major decisions for a child jointly. For example:

 Many schools will require the agreement of both parents to enrol a child, whether there are orders in place for parental responsibility or not;
 If a parent moves a significant distance from the other parent without agreement, the other parent may bring an application in court to seek the return of the child;
 State laws may require the consent of both parents for certain medical procedures or treatment.

Shared parental responsibility 
If an order is made that 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility, then:

 those persons must make decisions about ""major long-term issues"" jointly;
 other issues (day-to-day issues) can be made independently.

""Major long-term issues"" is defined as issues ""about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature"" including:

 their education;
 their religious and cultural upbringing;
 their health;
 their name;
 changes to their living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.

There is no obligation for parents to jointly agree on decisions that are not about ""major long-term issues"".

Equal time arrangements 
It is a common misconception that the Family Law Act specifies that children should spend equal time with each parent. That is commonly inappropriate, particularly for children under school age.

The most common arrangements made in Australia are for children to live with their mother and spend regular time with their father. Equal time arrangements occur in approximately 9% of separated families.

Recording agreements and resolving disputes

Parenting Plans 
Separated parents can enter into a Parenting Plan pursuant to the Family Law Act, dealing with whom a child is to live, the time a child spends with another person, the allocation of parental responsibility and other matters.

A Parenting Plan is not enforceable by a Court. It cannot be registered in a Court (post amendments made in 2003). They are however, very commonly used and can be very useful for separated parents who do not want the inflexibility and cost involved in obtaining court orders.

Family Dispute Resolution 
Any prospective parties to parenting proceedings under the Family Law Act are required to obtain a ""section 60I certificate"". This certificate is obtained from a family dispute resolution practitioner, who will attempt to conduct a mediation (family dispute resolution) between the relevant parties.

Parties are exempt from the requirement to obtain a certificate in certain circumstances, including where there has been family violence or circumstances of urgency.

The Federal Circuit and Family Court Rules 2021 place further obligations on prospective applicants to attempt to resolve proceedings before filing an application.

Consent Orders 
Parents can agree to record their agreement by way of consent orders. If there is no current court case, they can apply to the court to record the orders. If agreement is reached during proceedings, consent orders can be made by the Registrar or Judge who is managing the matter.

The court must agree that the proposed orders are in the best interests of the subject child before they will be made.

Application to a Court 
Parties who cannot resolve their parenting dispute can apply for a court with jurisdiction under the Family Law Act to make parenting orders. These applications are generally made to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (or the Family Court of Western Australia in Western Australia).

Almost all parenting proceedings before a court will involve:

 the parties filing documents setting out the orders they seek and the material supporting those orders;
 dispute resolution (mediation, conciliation, family dispute resolution);
 the preparation of a Family Report by a qualified Family Consultant (generally a person with a social work or psychology background);
 case management by the Court.

Issues in Family Law Act proceedings

Independent Children's Lawyers 
The Court may appoint an Independent Children's Lawyer (an ICL) to represent a child's interests. An ICL does not act on the instructions of the child, but must form an independent view and act in relation to what the ICL believes is the best interests of the child. This contrasts to most state courts, where an ICL will act on the instructions of a child once they reach the age of 12. The test for when an ICL should be appointed considers factors including whether there are allegations of abuse, intractable conflict between the parties, a child of mature years and others.

Relocation 
Relocation matters are those in which a party seeks to move the residence of the child a substantial distance, so that it would impact on the time that the child spends with the other party. The Family Law Act does not address relocation matters and a body of case law has developed.

The best interests of the child remains the paramount consideration. The Court must consider all alternatives to a ""coercive order"" requiring a parent to move. The relocating party is not required to ""justify"" the reason to relocate.

Multiple applications (so called rule in Rice v Asplund) 
The Family Law Act does not limit a party filing further parenting proceedings after previous proceedings have been resolved, provided that the child is under the age of 18. The Court however will strike out applications that do not demonstrate a significant change of circumstances justifying a further application.

645,"The Bornean whiskered myotis (Myotis borneoensis) is a species of vesper bat endemic to Borneo.

Taxonomy 
It was described in 1984 by John Edwards Hill and Charles M. Francis as a subspecies of the Burmese whiskered bat (M. montivagus). However, a 2013 study reclassified it as a distinct species on morphological grounds, using cranial and dental features. This has also been followed by the American Society of Mammalogists, the IUCN Red List, and the ITIS.

Distribution 
It is only known from northeastern Borneo, where it is found in both the Indonesian state of Kalimantan and the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.

Status 
This species may be a cave-dweller, and thus may be at risk of disturbance from caving. As it is known to inhabit tall forests, it may also be at risk from deforestation. However, very little information is known about this species, and it is thus classified as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.
