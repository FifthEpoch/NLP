# Chapter 5
__5.1__ Train and test a movie review sentiment classification using the features presented in 5.2.1. You may add additional features if any comes to mind. You should scale the input features, process examples using matrix and vector multiplication, utilize methods mentioned in this chapter such as softmax, cross-entropy loss function, stochastic gradient descent, and regularization. 

Below are a set of training and test movie review samples taken from Rotten Tomatoes for Avatar: The Way of Water. ([souce](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_the_way_of_water))

| The film is GORGEOUS but I sure would have appreciated more about the planet and local wildlife and less warfare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |pos|
| I was bored. It wasn't realistic. How is a human military going to lose to bows and arrows?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |neg|
| Great story Line.

| The movie could have been alot shorter and still gotten the story in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |neu|

| visually stunning but the film lacked soul.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |neu|
| I was in awe of the cinematography and animation but felt the story line was awful especially when the harpooned all the whales!! I had to walk out-very disappointed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |neg|
| Avatar is still Avatar. Nothing new and nothing worse to call it bad, is somewhere in the middle. The new movie is an expansion of the Pandora universe and shows how would these people live in water. Its visual effect is just as good as the first one. This means that more than 10 years later James Cameron has successfully delivered the same effect to the screen and didn't offer us anything new, while we watch similar technology become commonplace amongst other movies and game titles. This movie would be much appreciated if it came out much sooner after the first one. This is not to say that it is a bad movie, but I don't think it was worthy to watch when it should have been delivered a long time ago, and especially when it takes around 3 hours to finish. |neu|
|none of its characters feel whole, even after three full hours|neg|
|Too long, needed less weapon fighting, I think. Rest of show was beautiful and well done! Loved the baby and children scenes!|pos|
|Graphics of course were amazing but the story was blah, no surprises and it just dragged on WAY too long.|neg|

|Astonishing! Enthralling! Exciting! Immersive! None of these words could sensibly be applied to the three-and-a-quarter-hour Wet Smurfahontas stodgeathon that is Avatar: The Way of Water.|neg|
|The movie Avatar was amazing and spiritual. It's was a perfect 10|pos|
|Good movie but a little too long. I liked the first one better but the special effects were better in part 2.|neu|
|Too much violence and they killed a whale during the movie. It was all unnecessary.|neg|
|It was an all around amazing experience:) The story and visuals were great. If you liked the original then this one is a must see!|pos|
