Improving educational equity, designing for MOOC learners, and more from OL
Making education more equitable
The latest in teaching, learning, and research from MIT Open Learning (OL).
Dear Wun,
Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, has the right to access the resources they need to achieve their education and career goals. This is what we mean by educational equity—and it’s a driving force behind Open Learning’s mission to transform education around the world.
Recently, MIT OpenCourseWare teamed up with a network of US-based Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to begin curating culturally relevant open education resources (OER) that support faculty and students teaching and learning in Africana, African American, and Black Studies programs. The collaboration marks an important step in improving educational equity and in OCW’s efforts to share educational materials that anyone can freely adapt to their contexts. Take, for instance, a group of medical students in Turkey who are doing just that, using OCW courses in mathematics, the sciences, and computer science to develop their own PhD-level research curriculum.
Elsewhere at OL, the work of improving access to educational opportunities continues to make great strides. At this month’s Open Learning Talk on learner-centered course design, the MITx team shared guidelines for designing massive open online courses (MOOCs) tailored to the specific needs and motivations of learners from diverse backgrounds.
As the year comes to a close, we’re wishing you and yours good health and happiness—and we hope you’ll continue to open learning with us in the New Year!
Thanks for reading,
tom
