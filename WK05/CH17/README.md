# Chapter 17

__17.1__ Implement the algorithm to convert arbitrary context-free grammars to CNF. Apply your program to the L1 grammar.

[WIP] See CKY_parser.py

__17.2__ Implement the CKY algorithm and test it with your converted L1 grammar.

[WIP] See CKY_parser.py05

__17.3__ Rewrite the CKY algorithm given in Fig. 17.12 on page 370 so that it can accept grammars that contain unit productions.

__17.4__ Discuss how to augment a parser to deal with input that may be incorrect, for example, containing spelling errors or mistakes arising from automatic speech recognition.

__17.5__ Implement the PARSEVAL metrics described in Section 17.8. Next, use a parser and a treebank, compare your metrics against a standard implementation. Analyze the errors in your approach.
